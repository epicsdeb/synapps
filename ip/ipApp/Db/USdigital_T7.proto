# USdigital T7 single-axis inclinometer RS232 support
# 
# This code is based on support for the X3, which is 3-axis.  I left it this way because
# there is a possibility that USdigital will make a 3-axis version of the T7.  USdigital
# no longer sells the X3.
#
# Hex 010180 is sent to the device.  It will respond with with an echo of the received command,
# followed by three 4-byte angles.  The single-axis T7's angle will be in the third word.  This
# is followed by 2 bytes for the temperature and 1 byte for the checksum which is ignored for now.
