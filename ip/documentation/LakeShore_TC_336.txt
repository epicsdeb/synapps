***** Notes on Control Parameters that are unique             
***** to the LakeShore 336 (versus other LS models). 

The 'Manual' setting (percentage override of the power output)  sets 
the output power in 'Open Loop' mode. The 'SetPoint' parameter is ignored.

Zone Mode is basically 'Closed Loop' but with a internal LS 336 table that changes
the Control Settings based on crossing Setpoint thresholds.

Loop 3 and 4 are voltage (+/-10.00) outputs that can be used to control external
power supplies. They don't do closed loop control.

Loop 3 and 4 Only Modes:
'Monitor Output' causes Loop 3 and 4 output to track the selected input (See ANALOG command).

'Warmup Supply' is used to output a constant voltage (Loop 3 and 4) UNTIL the 'Setpoint'
is reached. (see WARMUP command).
