Omega DP41 Setup Info
---------------------------

- StreamDevice RS232 support written by Mark Rivers

- EPICS Files: Omega_DP41.db, Omega_DP41.proto, Omega_DP41.adl, Omega_DP41_settings.adl,
               Omega_DP41_settings.req, Omega_DP41.substitutions

- Omega DP41 Settings (set from front panel):
   BAUD:    9600
   SERCNF:  0,0
   DAT FT:  0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
   BUS FT:  0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1
                ^
                |
  *** NOTE ***  |.. Third bit of BUS FT is "ECHO response".  This is the command echo.
                    It should be on (1) for the newer streamDevice support, off (0)
                    if using the older database-only support.

- Omega_DP41.substitutions (create this file in your ioc directory):
  file "$(IP)/ipApp/Db/Omega_DP41.db"
  {
  pattern
  {P,      PORT,         R,        SCAN,       LOPR,   HOPR,  PREC, EGU,  CONFIG_SCAN}
  {xxx:,   serial1,   DP41:1:,    "2 second",    0,    200,     2,    PSI, "Passive"}

- In serial.cmd:
  tyGSAsynInit("serial1",  0, 0, 9600,'N',2,7,'N',"\r","\r") /* Omega DP41 */

  # OMEGA DP41 Panel Meter
  dbLoadTemplate("Omega_DP41.substitutions")

- Omega_DP41.substitutions sets the PREC parameter.  This MUST MATCH the
  display precision of the DP41 meter.

- RS-232 connection:
  RJ12  db9

- Note:
  From Mark's notes regarding the serial setup:
  
#          . . .         Omega meters.  They are nominally
# 8 data bits and 1 stop bit.  However, they actually always
# set bit 7(MSB)=1, which results in non-printable ASCII.
# Work around this problem by setting the Moxa terminal server
# to 7 data bits and 2 stop bits.
