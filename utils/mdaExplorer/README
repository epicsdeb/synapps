mdaExplorer is a GUI program, based on wxPython and matplotlib, for exploring
MDA files.  The MDA file format is described in the synApps sscan module, and
is written by that module's saveData program.

mdaExplorer.py - This is the main program.

mdaTree.py     - Routines to read an MDA file and collect information into a
                 tree (an instance of wx.TreeCtrl)

mda_f.py       - A faster version of mda.py, which uses f_xdrlib.py to read
                 arrays in big chunks, rather than element by element.

f_xdrlib.py    - A modified copy of xdrlib.py, software from Python 2.5 which
                 uses the Python struct module to convert data from an XDR
				 file to native Python variables

InstallSteps*.txt - The procedure I went through to install Python 2.5 and all
                    the python-related stuff needed to run mdaExplorer.
