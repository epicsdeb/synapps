<h2>Records</h2>

<dl>
<P><dt><a href="aCalcoutRecord.html">aCalcoutRecord.html</a>
<dd>The <b>aCalcout</b> record is much like the <b>calcout</b> record in EPICS base, but it
supports array fields and calculations, and its output link can wait for completion.

<P><dt><a href="sCalcoutRecord.html">sCalcoutRecord.html</a>
<dd>The <b>sCalcout</b> record is much like the <b>calcout</b> record in EPICS base, but it
supports string fields and calculations, and its output link can wait for completion.

<P><dt><a href="transformRecord.html">transformRecord.html</a>
<dd>The <b>transform</b> record is sort of like 16 <b>calcout</b> records collected together
into a single record.  The 16 calc expressions use a common set of 16
value fields, but each calc expression writes to its own value field.

<P><dt><a href="swaitRecord.html">swaitRecord.html</a>

<dd>The <b>swait</b> record is much like the <b>calcout</b> record in EPICS
base, but it uses an older form of retargetable links, and its output link waits
for completion.  The <b>swait</b> record is not recommended for new development;
use a <b>calcout</b> record instead.

<h2>EPICS Databases, MEDM display files, and autosave-request files</h2>




<dl>

<P><dt>
arrayTest.db<br>
arrayTest.adl

<dd>This database contains an <b>aSub</b> record that maintains two array fields:
"$(P)arrayTest.VALA", and "$(P)arrayTest.VALB".  The "VALB"
field contains double values from 0 to $(N)-1, where $(N) is a macro supplied to
the <tt>dbLoadRecords()</tt> command that loads the database.  The "VALA"
field  contains double values from M to M+$(N)-1, where M is supplied at run
time to the field "$(P)arrayTest_start".

<P><dt>CalcRecord.adl<br>
CalcRecord_full.adl

<dd>The <b>calc</b> record, in EPICS base, does not come with display files.  But,
frequently, one would like to  be able to display and interact with a <b>calc</b>
record embedded in a database.  The files serve that purpose.

<P><dt>

calcBitwiseExamples.adl<br>
calcMiscExamples.adl<br>
calcRelationalExamples.adl<br>

calcout_settings.req

<dd>The <b>calcout</b> record, in EPICS base, does not come with an autosave-request
file.

<P><dt>
yyCalcoutRecord.adl<br>
yyCalcoutRecord_full.adl

<dd>The <b>calcout</b> record, in EPICS base, does not come with display files.  But,
frequently, one would like to  be able to display and interact with a <b>calcout</b>
record embedded in a database.  The files serve that purpose.

interp.db<br>
interp_settings.req<br>
interp.adl

<dd>This database implements array interpolation, and hosts three arrays: an
independent variable array, X, whose PV name is "$(P)interp.VALA"); and two
dependent variable arrays, Y1(X) and Y2(X), whose PV names are, respectively,
"$(P)interp.VALB", and "$(P)interp.VALC".

<P>The arrays can be loaded at boot time, using autosave; written to at run time
by a CA client; or built up element by element at run time, by setting the MODE
switch ("$(P)interp_mode") to "Add Entry".

<P>To interpolate, one sets the mode switch to "Interpolate", and writes
a number to the X-input field, "$(P)interp_x".  This causes an underlying
<b>aSub</b> record to interpolate the Yi arrays to find values that would
correspond with that value of X, to display them as "$(P)interp_y1" and
"$(P)interp_y2", and, optionally, to write them to the external PVs named in the
link fields "$(P)interp_y1.OUT", and "$(P)interp_y2.OUT".

<P>The interpolation performed is a Lagrange interpolation, where the degree of
the polynomial can be specified by writing to "$(P)interp.F".  The order must be
in the range 1..10.  Currently the database doesn't visibly enforce these
limits, but silently clips to them if they are violated.

<p>To add an element to the arrays, one sets the mode switch to "Add
Element", writes Yi values to "$(P)interp_y1" and
"$(P)interp_y2", and then writes the corresponding X value to
"$(P)interp_x".  The number of entries, "$(P)interp_n" will then
increase by one.

<P>The arrays can be cleared by setting the mode switch to "Clear All" and
writing anything to X.

<P>For more information, see <a href="interp.README">interp.README</a>.

userAve10.db<br>
userAve10_settings.req<br>
userAve.adl<br>
userAve10.adl<br>

<dd>These files implement, manage, and display a set of 10 <b>sub</b> records
programmed (thanks to Frank Lenkszus) to calculate the average of M values,
where M is given by "$(P)userAve$(N).A", which are read via the input link
"$(P)userAve$(N).INPB".  Alternatively, the <b>sub</b> record can be made to fit
recorded values, seen as a function of time, to a line, and to return the line
evaluated at the time of the most recently recorded value.  This is very similar
to an average, if the true value is constant.  If the true value varies with
time, the line fit produces a better estimate of the signal's true value than an
average.

<P>These records are intended for use in run-time programming.  With either
algorithm, the records can operate in two ways:

<dl>

<P><dt>Running average/fit ("$(P)userAve$(N)_mode" == "CONTINUOUS")

<dd>After M values have been recorded, output the average (line-fit result) of
the most recent M value whenever a new value is read.

<P><dt>One-shot average/fit ("$(P)userAve$(N)_mode" == "ONE-SHOT")

<dd>Clear the output, read M values, output the average (line-fit result) of
those values, and ignore new values until a restart command is received
("$(P)userAve$(N).C is set to 1).

</dl>

<P>In either mode, the record uses its alarm field to indicate whether the
output value it is displaying ("$(P)userAve$(N).VAL") is valid (i.e., is the
result of M readings).  Until M readings have been read, the record will be in
alarm (STAT=="SOFT", SEVR=="MAJOR").  After M readings have been treated,
STAT=="NO_ALARM", SEVR=="NO_ALARM".

<dd>A <i>userCalc</i> is simply a <b>swait</b> record implemented for use in
run-time programming.  "Implemented" means that a database containing several
uncommitted <b>swait</b> records, with an overall enable switch, is loaded;
corresponding entries are made in autosave files to save and restore selected
field values; and reasonably comprehensive MEDM displays are provided so that a
user can exercise most of the records' features.

<blockquote>
Although the <b>swait</b>
record is not recommended for new development, it is retained in this case
because many users have become accustomed to the way it behaves -- in
particular, to the way its links are programmed: they take only a PV name,
without the link attributes (e.g., NPP, NMS) that standard EPICS links have.

<h2 align="center">How to build and use</h2>
<ul>

<li>Edit <code>configure/RELEASE</code> to specify the paths to <b>EPICS
base</b>, and to the <b>sscan</b> module.  If you don't have <b>sscan</b>, or
don't want it to be used by the <b>calc</b> module, comment the definition out,
and the <b>calc</b> module will adjust its build accordingly.  The only thing
<b>calc</b> can't build without <b>sscan</b> is the swait record, which is
retained in <b>calc</b> mostly for historical reasons.

<blockquote>

The swait record is the original "userCalc" record, and many users at APS have
become accustomed to the way it works.  The calcout record from EPICS base, with
"Async Soft Channel" device support, is a reasonable substitute for the swait
record,

</blockquote>

<li>Run Gnu Make to build.
<li>Note that the <b>calc</b> module is not useful on its own, but only produces
code that can be used by other modules.  (A good example of a module that uses
the calc module is synApps' <b>xxx</b> module.) A module that uses <b>calc</b>
should include <code>calcSupport.dbd</code> into the <code>.dbd</code> file it
creates for loading into an ioc, or for export to other modules, and it should
link to <code>libcalc</code>.
</ul>
