<P>Release 1.1.0

<dl>

<p><dt>Modified drvAsynDG645.cpp, drvDG645.db, and DG645 screens.<br>
<dd><br>Removed race condition when there were multiple DG645 devices,
simplified the code a bit, and had driver use DrvInfo field.  Added
new "Advanced Triggering" fields: mode enable/disable, prescale phases
and trigger holdoff.  Added a label for the device.  Redid the
screens, and removed the reference to the asyn record on the main
screen.  As the delay PV names were changed to make it simpler to open
the individual delay screens, the rest of the PV names were changed to
be consistent (where the first letter is now capitalized).

<p><dt>Moved all Gigabuadics support files (digitalDelay.*) into
file called "digitalDelay.tar.gz", in the "src" directory.<br>
<dd><br>This code was based on a custom hardware implementation of a
solution for using a specific Gigabaudics delay generator.  It is
highly unlikely that anyone has used this code, and if it was used, it
can be moved back into position by untarring the file in the root of
the module.

<p><dt>Modified OPI files:<br>
BNC_505.opi<br>
colbyMain.opi<br>
delaygen.opi<br>
devDG535.opi<br>
