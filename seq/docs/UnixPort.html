<h1>
EPICS sequencer Unix port</h1>
This document contains notes on the port of the EPICS sequencer to Unix.
Comments are welcome.

<hr WIDTH="100%">Requirements</h1>

<ol>
<li>
The sequencer will run under both Unix and VxWorks (or other RTOS)</li>

<li>
Performance under VxWorks will not be significantly worse (say not more
than 5% worse) than that of the existing sequencer</li>

<li>
Access to the control system will be via either CDEV or CA (maybe implemented
using #ifdefs but preferably via a thin message system-independent layer,
which would permit other sufficiently functional message systems to be
interfaced)</li>

<li>
Operating system access will be via Marty Kraimer's new "OSI" layer, developed
(as a collaboration) as necessary</li>

<li>
Overall file structure will not change unnecessarily (in parallel with
this effort will be an effort, spear-headed by Greg White, to add various
new syntax to SNL)</li>

<li>
The SNL compiler should build without access to any EPICS include files
or libraries</li>

<li>
The SNL run-time support should build with access only to the OSI library
and to the control system access layer (CDEV, CA, or system-independent
layer)</li>
</ol>

<h1>

<hr WIDTH="100%">Portability of SNL compiler and generated C code</h1>

<ol>
<li>
The SNL compiler is nearly EPICS-independent; whilst one file includes
cadef.h (gen_ss_code.c) and two files include dbDefs.h (gen_ss_code.c and
gen_tables.c), no definitions in these include files are used</li>

<li>
The sole dependence comes from the use of the EPICS time-stamp format;
one file (gen_tables.c) includes tsDefs.h via seqCom.h; this can be avoided
by defining a SEQ_TIME_STAMP structure which is (for now at least) identical
to the EPICS one</li>

<li>
The generated C code is completely independent of EPICS (TS_STAMP is only
used when the pvTimeStamp() routine is used) and the only VxWorks dependence
is an unused OPT_VXWORKS option</li>

<li>
I have made the changes to avoid the above problems</li>
</ol>

<h1>

<hr WIDTH="100%">Portability of run-time environment</h1>

<ol>
<li>
The string "ca_" occurs in 4 files:</li>

<ul>
<li>
seq.h:1, seq_ca.c:19, seq_if.c:13, seq_task.c:18</li>
</ul>

<li>
The string "task" occurs in 8 files:</li>

<ul>
<li>
seq.h:6, seq_ca.c:11, seq_if.c:3, seq_mac.c:6, seq_main.c:42, seq_prog.c:9,
seq_qry.c:29, seq_task.c:81</li>
</ul>

<li>
The string "sem" occurs in 6 files:</li>

<ul>
<li>
seq.h:7, seq_ca.c:2, seq_if.c:12, seq_main.c:13, seq_prog.c:17, seq_task.c:26</li>
</ul>

<li>
The first thing to do is simply to replace task and sem calls with the
appropriate ones from Marty's newBase</li>

<li>
Any missing routines or problems can be addressed as they arise</li>

<li>
The CA calls can be left more-or-less unchanged for now, since they exist
under Unix; however I believe that Unix CA is not thread-safe and also
that ca_import() and friends are not supported under Unix, so some changes
will be necessary; initially, I suggest minimal changes to make things
compile</li>

<li>
We can add a rule to Makefile.Host to build a Unix libSeq.The Unix C output
from snc should now link OK against libSeq, libOsi and libca (maybe libCom
too?)</li>

<li>
Now we need to ensure that the CA&nbsp; / CDEV interface works properly;
I don't know whether CDEV is thread-safe but I don't think we can assume
that CDEV services are all thread-safe, so I think we will need to restrict
message system i/o to a single thread in any case</li>

<li>
From a quick look at the code, CA / CDEV seems to be handled more nicely
in alh than in medm; the alh approach looks close to having a message-system
independent layer and may be the approach to use/develop for the sequencer</li>
</ol>

<h1>

<hr SIZE=5 WIDTH="100%">Notes on port to Solaris and Linux</h1>

<ol>
<li>
Remaining sections were written after the initial port to Solaris and Linux;
they document the experience of that port</li>
</ol>

<h1>

<hr WIDTH="100%">Missing features</h1>

<ol>
<li>
task delete hooks and task suspension are used for sequence deletion (although
only because the VxWorks excTask has no floating point support)</li>

<ul>
<li>
should try to avoid this in the sequencer via a higher-level OSI mechanism?</li>

<li>
I don't think we can support full VxWorks task hook functionality under
Posix</li>
</ul>

<li>
threads register with the EPICS task watchdog; this is probably useful
functionality to have in OSI (c.f. ring.cc)</li>

<li>
uses ca_import() and ca_import_cancel()</li>

<li>
uses ioGlobalStdGet() to get fd for standard output; this is necessary
is it? can't just use "1"? also uses STD_IN (#define'd as 0)</li>

<li>
uses errnoGet() and printErrno()</li>

<li>
uses taskIdFigure()</li>

<li>
uses ioctl() for FIOSYNC and FIOGETNAME; portable?</li>
</ol>

<h1>

<hr WIDTH="100%">EPICS dependencies</h1>

<ol>
<li>
The portable sequencer still uses the following EPICS include files:</li>

<ul>
<li>
cadef.h (CA)</li>

<li>
epicsTypes.h (epicsBoolean, epicsIndex and epicsStatus)</li>

<li>
ellLib.h (linked-list prototypes)</li>
</ul>

<li>
Unix sequencers must be linked against the following EPICS libraries:</li>

<ul>
<li>
libca.a (CA)</li>

<li>
libCom.a (epicsPrintf() but also lots of stuff used by CA)</li>
</ul>

<li>
I think that OSI could/should provide an OSItypes.h and a list.h / list.cc
(c.f. ring.h / ring.cc)</li>

<li>
I also think that OSI could/should contain a reporting / logging API in
place of epicsPrintf()</li>

<li>
This is a non-exhaustive list of the libCom facilities used by CA, together
with comments as to whether they could reasonably be in OSI:</li>

<ul>
<li>
tsStampToText() (OSI)</li>

<li>
bucketLib (OSI)</li>

<li>
epicsAssert() (OSI)</li>

<li>
envLib, EPICS_CA_SERVER_PORT etc. (?)</li>

<li>
freeListLib (OSI)</li>

<li>
ellLib (OSI; see above)</li>

<li>
errlogLib (OSI; see above)</li>

<li>
aToIPAddr() (?)</li>

<li>
bsdSockLib (OSI)</li>

<li>
installSignPipeIgnore() (?)</li>
</ul>

<li>
Should all these be in OSI? is there a problem with CA retaining references
to things in libCom? maybe not</li>
</ol>

<h1>

<hr WIDTH="100%">OSIsem</h1>

<ol>
<li>
should have semaphore initializer; don't assume zero?</li>

<li>
used a base class (needed so could use base class pointer in the C interface)</li>

<li>
added OSIsem:: static definitions (so it can work with the Solaris implementation)</li>
</ol>

<h1>

<hr WIDTH="100%">OSIthread</h1>

<ol>
<li>
under VxWorks (NB, addressed if there were an abstract base class):</li>

<ul>
<li>
fixed GetPriority -> getPriority and SetPriority -> setPriority</li>

<li>
added getStackSize</li>

<li>
corrected C OSIthreadNameToId return type</li>
</ul>

<li>
should have an OSI type for priority (and avoid application knowledge of
actual priority values, range, whether 0 is low or high etc.; currently
I am ignoring priority with Posix threads)</li>

<li>
similarly, how are portable programs to set stack sizes (currently I am
ignoring stack sizes with Posix threads)?</li>

<li>
Posix implementation needs to review key usage (c.f. task variables) and
to protect key creation via a semaphore</li>

<li>
need to re-work the logic on thread creation; thread needs to execute an
OSI-supplied wrapper before invoking the application routine; the wrapper
should wait for creation completion in a secure way</li>

<li>
made setDestroySafe() and Unsafe() static (this makes sense at least for
VxWorks and Posix)</li>

<li>
OSIthreadName() shouldn't return pointer</li>

<li>
need taskIdFigure() or equivalent?</li>

<li>
would like known "null" thread id (is int under VxWorks?)</li>
</ol>

<h1>

<hr WIDTH="100%">OSItime</h1>

<ol>
<li>
under VxWorks:</li>

<ul>
<li>
added getCurrentTime returning double</li>
</ul>

<li>
is dependent on tsDefs.h and TS_STAMP; do we want this?</li>

<li>
fixed 1970->1990 correction (was 19 years) under both VxWorks and Solaris</li>
</ol>

<h1>

<hr WIDTH="100%">C++ issues</h1>

<ol>
<li>
shouldn't the interface seen by the OS-independent program be defined in
an abstract base class and shouldn't the OS-specific implementations inherit
from it? that way, adherence to the interface can be checked by the compiler</li>

<li>
why implement the C++ and C versions independently? is this due to efficiency
concerns? for Posix, I implemented in C++ and made the C wrappers call
the C++</li>
</ol>

<h1>

<hr WIDTH="100%">CA</h1>

<ol>
<li>
hacked in OSI locks for Solaris (should base on "Unix" rather than Solaris)</li>

<li>
changed osiSleep() call to use OSIthreadsleep() (may have been stack overflow
problem...)</li>

<li>
really want to remove special VxWorks code as far as possible and rely
on OSI; would give ca_import() etc., which the sequencer uses/needs</li>
</ol>

<h1>

<hr WIDTH="100%">Misc OSI and sequencer</h1>

<ol>
<li>
error handling: want consistent way of knowing whether a feature is missing
(maybe a set of enquiry routines and applications or library init routines
should verify that the features that they require are present; don't always
want to return an error at run-time; sometimes prefer just to do nothing...)</li>

<li>
need to check that timeouts are being handled consistently as FP seconds
everywhere (were VxWorks ticks)</li>

<li>
why do I need ::thr_suspend() and not :: for the Posix ones?</li>

<li>
strictly you should compile with _POSIX_C_SOURCE set to 199506L under Solaris
to use Posix threads; however, I just defined _REENTRANT (convenient because
EPICS is already built that way) and, touch wood, everything is OK</li>

<li>
want to move libCom OSI stuff to src/osi (confusing at present)</li>

<li>
mustn't forget to go through the thread and sem implementations and ensure
that all available options are being used correctly, errors being checked
for etc.</li>

<li>
note that can't delete sequencers under VxWorks; have commented out the
ca_import and delete stuff; must get to that</li>

<li>
fixed errlogInit problem under VxWorks (was never setting the "initialized"
flag to TRUE); still get two "errlog" tasks?!</li>

<li>
want to support local variables and "long i, j;" declarations</li>

<li>
should detect bad pvGetQ (etc) usage (i.e. initialize queue index to -1
and test before use... at compile time if possible)</li>
</ol>

<h1>

<hr WIDTH="100%">Message system</h1>

<ol>
<li>
want to be able to use the sequencer with CA, CDEV and KTL (although KTL
only via CDEV might be OK)</li>

<li>
will not use "#ifdef CDEV" approach but will instead go via generic API,
"PV"</li>

<li>
need to replace all CA calls and also all DBR usage; the API should define
its own simple type scheme (sequencer uses only DBR_xxx and DBR_TIME_xxx,
which is status, severity, time-stamp and value; xxx values used are CHAR,
SHORT, LONG, FLOAT, DOUBLE, STRING)</li>

<li>
CA routines and constants used are:</li>

<ul>
<li>
ca_task_initialize()</li>

<li>
ca_build_and_connect()</li>

<li>
ca_import()</li>

<li>
ca_field_type()</li>

<li>
ca_element_count()</li>

<li>
ca_puser()</li>

<li>
ca_add_array_event()</li>

<li>
ca_array_get_callback()</li>

<li>
ca_array_put()</li>

<li>
ca_flush_io()</li>

<li>
ca_pend_event()</li>

<li>
ca_clear_event()</li>

<li>
ca_clear_channel()</li>

<li>
ca_import_cancel()</li>

<li>
ca_task_exit()</li>

<li>
ECA_DISCONN</li>

<li>
ECA_NORMAL</li>

<li>
ECA_TIMEOUT</li>
</ul>

<li>
so will define pvInit(), pvGet() etc. interface and will implement pvCa.cc,
pvCdev.cc, pvKtl.cc etc. plus add Makefile support (will stop short of
run-time shareable library activation; use CDEV if you want that)</li>

<li>
have to worry about ca_import(), ca_import_cancel(); from looking at CA
code, it's OK to ignore ca_import() and ca_import_cancel() if <i>all</i>
threads in an application are to share a CA context; they are needed if
some do and some don't</li>

<li>
have to worry about locking; can't assume that the library under the pv
layer is thread-safe, so the pv layer will implement its own locking (using
OSI locks); a single mutex will ensure that only one thread at a time is
within the pv library</li>
</ol>

<h1>

<hr WIDTH="100%">PV (see also the list in this <a href="pvDescr.html#Problems">PV-specific
document</a>)</h1>

<ol>
<li>
<font color="#000000">error handling is poor; could implement a "maximize
severity" and/or error stack scheme; could use C++ exceptions? also could
maintain on a per-variable rather than a per-system basis? it
</font>also
ignores multi-threaded issues (maybe use thread-specific data?)</li>

<li>
useful to add "valid" flags to classes? then destructors can set them to
FALSE (would protect against use of destroyed objects)</li>

<li>
really sort out use of const wherever possible (will need to retrofit somewhat);
get into the habit of using it!</li>

<li>
not queueing callbacks when called from within initiating routine (OK,
but need to document)</li>

<li>
TS_STAMP... what to do? OSI uses it</li>

<li>
KTL type conversions not fully implemented</li>

<li>
KTL problem: need to perform operation on keyword in order to trigger search
and therefore connection hander</li>

<li>
idea of supporting KTL_ID ioctl() and read/write (backwards compatible
but would allow channel info to be cached)</li>

<li>
now working nicely with KTL; major problem is the fact that have to monitor
everything so that a connection remains open (related to KTL_ID notion)</li>

<li>
not working under VxWorks; compiles but channels don't connect</li>

<li>
demo sequence doesn't behave well on channel disconnect under KTL (probably
CAKE problem)</li>
</ol>

<h1>

<hr WIDTH="100%">14-Feb-00</h1>

<ol>
<li>
After a long gap, have returned...</li>

<li>
Greg White's changes were merged in in Oct-99</li>

<li>
Have packaged up a Linux / Solaris demo and tagged as FEB00</li>

<li>
other issues:</li>

<ul>
<li>
while building KTL with Workshop 5.0, used "-Xc" and this broke KTL signal
code (avoided using it...)</li>
</ul>
</ol>

<h1>

<hr WIDTH="100%">01-Mar-00</h1>

<ol>
<li>
Have made good progress with the new OSI and with cleaning up sequencer
code so that it should run unchanged (and without any of those nasty "###"
comments) under at least Solaris, Linux and VxWorks</li>

<li>
Now is the time to sit back and make those final punch-lists</li>
</ol>

<h4>
Sequencer</h4>

<ol>
<li>
support building of a shareable library</li>

<li>
complete the local variable and "long i, j;" support</li>

<li>
avoid warnings re use of NULL and ASYNC (use different names, e.g. pvPutCallback())</li>

<li>
in PV&nbsp;layer, setting error status each time, regardless of new error
(should clear message on success?)</li>

<li>
in PV layer, bootstrap error problem: how to report pvSysCreate() failure?)</li>

<li>
NB, in-built assumption that only one state-set reads/writes a given PV</li>

<li>
get rid of all (possible) compilation warnings</li>

<li>
stop using doubles for intervals?</li>

<li>
use same DEBUG macro approach everywhere</li>
</ol>

<h4>
KTL</h4>

<ol>
<li>
finalize CAKE parallel completion support (allow on "wait", not just "notify";
requires new keywords to be backwards-compatible)</li>

<li>
add type conversion (currently fails quietly); adjust the module written
for CDEV/CORBA?</li>

<li>
add time-stamp support</li>

<li>
define COKE parallel completion support</li>

<li>
check for leaks with string/array callbacks</li>

<li>
need lock in pvKtl.cc for error strings</li>

<li>
need to maintain list to permit more than one keyword object per underlying
keyword (KTL name lookup issue)</li>
</ol>

<h4>
Testing</h4>

<ol>
<li>
extract wfccas2 code to make general standalone CA server that will configure
itself from .db and .dbd files (but have no scanning or device support)</li>

<li>
still some memory leak issues on sequencer deletion</li>
</ol>

<h4>
Documentation</h4>

<ol>
<li>
re-write manual (wants a major overhaul; current one is very hard to use
as a reference work)</li>

<li>
include full description of PV layer (enough info to write a new service,
e.g. CDEV)</li>
</ol>

<h4>
General</h4>

<ol>
<li>
need README (or README.html) files in all directories</li>

<li>
need packaging up per the Andrew Johnson recommendations</li>

<li>
make default build KTL-independent but make it easy to build KTL-specific
test directories</li>

<li>
Solaris Workshop 5.0 problems (-Xc broke KTL signal code; had to disable
exceptions; some un-demangeable names; switched to g++; can't run purify!)</li>

<li>
would like error log messages to be identified like syslog messages (hostname
is not enough)</li>
</ol>
