Known Problems
==============

.. _Known_Problems_2.1.10:

Known Problems in Release 2.1.10
--------------------------------

In the warning message when a queue is full, the variable name
should be quoted. Here is an example::

  sevr=minor pvPut on queued variable response (anonymous): last queue
  element overwritten (queue is full)

Here "response" is actually the variable name, but this is not apparent.


.. _Known_Problems_2.1.8:

Known Problems in Release 2.1.8
-------------------------------

Build fails on some windows systems due to a stupid bug in
src/snc/Makefile.

.. _Known_Problems_2.1.7:

Known Problems in Release 2.1.7
-------------------------------

* In some cases the parallel build (make -j) fails inside src/snc.
  The rule for generating the parser (using lemon) is executed twice
  in parallel.

* In certain cases the code generated by snc can have a naming
  conflict i.e. different functions get the same name. The
  following code fragment demonstrates this case::

    ss x { state y_z { ... } }
    ss x_y { state z { ... } }

.. _Known_Problems_2.1.6:

Known Problems in Release 2.1.6
-------------------------------

All these are fixed in the latest snapshot and in the next release.

* The (undocumented) snc option -i disables generation of iocsh
  registration code. This option should *not* be used, even if
  the program runs on vxWorks without an iocsh. Furthermore, the ::

    registrar(<programName>Registrar)

  line *must* be included in the dbd file.

  If *no* registrar
  entries exist, global variables are not properly initialized,
  leading to an assertion failure when the first program is started.

  If only some entries exist, seqShow will only display the ones
  that have been registered.

* Sometimes seqShow with no arguments does not display all programs
  and state sets in a table as it is supposed to do. This happens if
  there is (at least) one state set that has not yet been started,
  for instance if not all channels have connected yet. seqShow (with
  no arguments) then acts as if you gave it the name of such a program.

* Build on a Debian Linux system failed due to missing header files.
  It seems this is caused by ``USR_CFLAGS += -I$(TOP)/src/seq`` lines
  in some Makefiles. William Steele reported this and also provided
  the fix, which is to replace these with
  ``USR_INCLUDES += -I$(TOP)/src/seq``.

.. _Known_Problems_2.1.5:

Known Problems in Release 2.1.5
-------------------------------

These are all fixed in the latest snapshot.

* Using pvPutComplete or pvGetComplete inside a when-clause may
  result in a deadlock: the state set forever waits for the
  completion even though the callback arrived.

  Note: this Problem is present at least since 2.0.12.

  Note also: standard CA thread priorities hide this problem, so the
  symptoms do not appear on VxWorks and RTEMS; they appear only if
  epics thread priorities are reversed (or ignored, as is typically
  the case for soft IOCs running in user mode on Linux or Windows).

* In safe mode, if a variable is monitored and sync'ed, it can
  happen that an event is detected with efTestAndClear
  but the underlying variable still has the old value.

  You should avoid using efTestAndClear together with conditions
  that test the value of the underlying variable; this may lead
  to an apparently "lost event", i.e. the event flag gets cleared
  but no state transition happens. Instead use efTest, and
  clear the flag in the action block only after you have actually
  got the new value.

* The asynchronous versions of pvPut and pvGet built-in functions
  do not behave correctly in case of connection loss. Particularly,
  if connection is lost when waiting for completion, the state set
  that issued the command will not be woken, so that it will wait
  for the full timeout (the hard-coded 10 seconds).

  Thanks to Daniel Keating for finding
  this bug and pointing me in the right direction how to fix it.

* The compiler crashes when an assign clause lists more PVs than
  the array contains elements.

* The compiler reports wrong line numbers (and could potentially
  crash, though I did not experience this) when SNL or C code is
  included with an un-escaped preprocessor #include command.

* In safe mode, anonymous PVs deviate from named PVs in the behaviour
  of event flags: Normally, event flags for monitored PVs will be
  set when entering the first state because of the first monitor event
  we get from CA after connecting. This should be emulated for
  anonymous PVs in order to restore the symmetry and so that named
  and anonymous PVs can be interchanged at will (as claimed in the docs).

.. _Known_Problems_2.1.4:

Known Problems in Release 2.1.4
-------------------------------

The builtin procedure pvAssign has several bugs:

* In safe mode, if an initially unassigned variable gets assigned
  at runtime using pvAssign, a subsequent pvGet crashes the program.

* When re-assigning a variable that is already connected to a PV, then
  you get warning messages like
  "sevr=minor XYZ connect event but already connected". It also looks as
  if not all resources associated with teh channel are correctly freed.
