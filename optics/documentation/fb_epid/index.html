    <p><strong>Purpose</strong>: use the EPICS epid record for generic software feedback</p>

    <h2>Theory of operation</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>A signal is available as an EPICS process variable (<strong>IN</strong>). The signal
        source can be in the same VME with the feedback software or in another VME (or other EPICS
        IOC) available on the network.</li>
      <li>An input calculation (swait record) is used to allow some flexibility for conditioning the
        input signal to the feedback.</li>
      <li>An epid record is used to provide real-time feedback and recalculate the output
        variable.</li>
      <li>The output from the epid record is buffered by the outbuf calculation which watches the
        Feedback ON (FBON) switch and retains the previous output value if the feedback software is
        switched off.</li>
      <li>An output calculation is used to allow some flexibility for conditioning the output signal
        to the positioner (<strong>OUT</strong>). The conditioned epid result is pushed to the
        positioner.</li>
      <li>A positioner responds to the result from the epid record and thus further modifies the
        input signal.</li>
      <li>The feedback can be switched on manually or automatically, subject to the logic of some
        other calculation (<strong>CALC</strong>). For example, a <em>shutter closed</em> signal
        could suspend feedback. In this case, the output is not driven.</li>
      <li>When the feedback is switched on, the positioner should not jerk to a different position.
        The feedback software must be prepared to start moving the positioner from its present
        location.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>How to use the database </h2>
    <p> Use one instance of this database for each feedback channel. If two different methods for
      feedback are desired for a given axis, call two instances of this database. For example, on
      33ID for feedback of the DCM crystal 2 PZT, one might choose either the XBPM position signal
      or the D3 graphite foil intensity to drive the PZT position.</p>

    <h1>User Configuration</h1>
    <p>Once the software has been installed (IOC configured with database and autosave/restore
      configured to retain settings across restarts of the IOC), some careful setup needs to happen
      before the software is ready to be used.</p>
    <p>First, it is necessary to identify the EPICS PVs for the control variable (such as a
      positioner or the power to a heating element) and the signal variable (the PV that is sampled
      for the PID loop). These may have been configured in the IOC but it is possible to change them
      while the IOC is running. They can be changed without need to recompile or restart the EPICS
      IOC.</p>
    <p>To avoid any unexpected consequences, be sure the <tt>fb_epid</tt> software is switched off
      before changing any PVs or changing between modes of operation. In the MEDM screen, in the
        <em>EPID output</em> section, press the button marked <em>off</em>. </p>
    <p>It is most important to make sure that the input signal is updated faster than the
      recalculation interval for the <tt>fb_epid</tt> software or instability will occur. A factor
      of 3 to 10 input updates per output update is reasonable. The output will be updated each time
      the <tt>epid</tt> is processed.</p>

    <h2>Setup of the calculations</h2>
    <p>The versatility of the <tt>fb_epid</tt> support lies in the various calculations that can be
      reconfigured by the user while the IOC is operating.</p>

    <h3>Setting the enable calculation</h3>
    <p>The operation of <tt>fb_epid</tt> is permitted when the result of the <em>enable</em>
      calculation is 1.0. The first, obvious, choice is that <tt>bo</tt> record is provided to the
      user to switch the <tt>fb_epid</tt> software on and off. But the software should also disable
      itself when the input signal goes out of range or also due to some other operating parameters. </p>
    <p>Other factors can be built into the <em>enable</em> calculation. For example, on undulator
      beam lines, it is not useful to run the feedback if the undulator is not operating (gap is
      closed or magnets are energized). In such a case, monitor the PV for the undulator gap (APS
      undulator A) and enable only if the gap is below some reasonable number such as 50 mm. </p>
    <p> One should also factor the <tt>fb_epid</tt> input signal into the <em>enable</em>
      calculation by checking that is within a valid operating range. </p>

    <h3>Setting the input calculation</h3>
    <p>It is possible to perform limited math on the input signal to be used. For example, when the
      goal is to maximize the conductance through a crystal pair, such as a monochromator, the best
      signal would be a ratio between detector immediately before and after the pair of crystals.
      The control variable would be the rotation angle of either of the two crystals (usually a fine
      rotation of the second crystal). The input calculation would then monitor the PVs for both
      detectors and calculate the ratio of the two: <tt>A/B</tt>. In this example, it would also be
      useful to include the PV of this calculation in the <em>enable</em> calculation and ensure
      that the ratio is acceptable.</p>

    <h3>Setting the limits on the output</h3>
    <p> To prevent the epid record from driving the control variable out of bounds, there are limits
      for low and high. The software will not allow the positioner to drive outside of these limits.
        <strong style="color: red">Editor: Is this correct or is it a clamp on the output or a reset
        if the value is found to go outside the range?</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>Tuning of the epid record</h2>
    <p>For more information about the EPICS <tt>epid</tt> record, see <a
        href="http://cars9.uchicago.edu/software/epics/epidRecord.html"
        >http://cars9.uchicago.edu/software/epics/epidRecord.html</a>. There is a special discussion
      on <a href="http://cars9.uchicago.edu/software/epics/epidRecord.html#Feedback%20Tuning"
        >feedback tuning</a> in PID mode.</p>
    <p>The epid record can run in either Max/Min or PID mode. Max/Min is used to maximize a positive
      input signal or minimize a negative input signal such as from a beam line detector. PID mode
      is used to keep the input signal at constant value such as holding a sample's temperature
      constant. </p>
    <p>
      <strong style="color: red">Editor: What is the role of the <em>Set Point</em> in PID
        mode?</strong> Probably need to check the epid record source code for this information. </p>

    <h3>Max/Min mode</h3>
    <p>Max/Min mode is useful for monochromator feedback or other situations where a positive signal
      is to be maximized (or a negative signal is to be minimized). The online <tt>epid</tt> record
      documentation is lacking details about this mode so one is referred to inspecting the <a
        href="https://subversion.xor.aps.anl.gov/trac/synApps/browser/trunk/support/std/vstub/stdApp/src/devEpidSoft.c"
        >source code</a>.</p>

    <h3>PID mode</h3>
    <p>PID mode is useful for holding the input signal to the <em>Set Point</em> by adjusting the
      control variable. The <a
        href="http://cars9.uchicago.edu/software/epics/epidRecord.html#Feedback%20Parameters"
          ><tt>epid</tt> record documentation</a> provides a good description of how to set the PID
      constants.</p>
