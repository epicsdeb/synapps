                       DXP 3-0 Things to do

- Get non-root access to USB Saturn systems working on Linux.  
  udev does not seem to be working like it did previously?

- EPP mode not working on Linux?  Or Windows?

- Implement correct horizontal axis scaling of baseline histogram and diagnostic traces
  
- When using the EPICS sscan record to do rapid data collection, the scan occasionally
  hangs up (every few hunded points) because the MCA record did not complete processing (?). 
  There are also occasional data dropouts (elapsed times and spectra are 0).
  Check this on Saturn and xMAP: still happening?
  
- Test performance when doing rapid scanning on all models, make at least as good as 2-11 corrected for small additional 
  overhead to read extra parameters to do accurate live time correction.

- Test all preset modes on Saturn and xMAP

- Test AutoApply and Apply
  - Measure improvement in iocInit compared to 2-10 release with 16 channel
    system
  
- Mapping mode:
  - Add read rate, MBytes to medm screen
  - Test gate and sync modes together - HAS PROBLEMS, WAIT FOR REPLY FROM PETER
  - Test saving TIFF and NeXus files
 
- Alphabetize the low-level parameters with a sort array.  Use this array to
  map between asynPortDriver parameter numbers and indices in the Handel array.

- Make the low-level parameter strings be PINI=YES, not I/O Intr, since they
  only need to process once at iocInit.

- Make sure all parameters have corresponding PVs, and eliminate any unneeded parameters

- Need to copy data to NDArray for callbacks to work in MCA mode.  Do we care
  about this?
  
- Add and test PollTime PV, add to medm screen

- Add and test ResetDelay, add to medm screen.  Add RCTau?  Display one or other depending on preamp type?

- Add polarity?
  
- Documentation of all the changes
