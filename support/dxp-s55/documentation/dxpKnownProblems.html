<h3>General problems.</h3>
<ol>
  <li>The baseline histogram readout and display sometimes stops working, and there
      is no data for the baseline histogram.
  <li>Counting for preset live time leads to actual elapsed live time
      being not close to requested time.  Sometimes actual live times are 
      less than preset, sometimes more than preset.  Should I be using
      a different parameter, ELIVETIME, rather than LIVETIME?
</ol>

<h3>Problems with DXP2X</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Setting EMAX=>35 leads to errors (cannot set gain to < -6dB) 
      when done in 1 big step,
      but can often get to same value in small steps or other direction
  <li>Changing peaking time on leads to big gain changes some times,
      re-setting EMAX fixes problems
  <li>Need to re-apply some settings (ADC rule, trigger?) after reboot
      sometimes.  Is this related to problem 1?
  <li>With non-modified version of md_wait in md_epics get errors in
      xiaStartSystem(), RUNSTAT=1 (run busy), usually on first channel
      in last module. Error is cannot set POLARITY, must stop run.
      This problem has been worked around by making md_wait in md_epics
      always wait for a minimum of 0.1 seconds, but this has a serious 
      performance hit and must be fixed.
  <li>vxWorks console output from Handel is being closed at end of st.cmd,
      so error messages don't appear unless the command 
      xiaSetLogOutput("stdout") is typed manually at the vxWorks prompt after
      the startup script completes.
</ol> 

<h3>Needed features</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Add ReadBaseline to dxpMED.db to read all baselines</li>
  <li>Implement ReadBaseline in dxpMED.st</li>
  <li>Add ReadBaseline scan rate to NNelement.adl
  <li>Add new fields to dxpRecord: MAX_WIDTH, BASE_CUT_ENABLE, 
      BASE_THRESH_ENABLE 
  <li>Add new fields to dxp_settings.req: MAX_WIDTH, BASE_CUT_ENABLE, 
      BASE_THRESH_ENABLE 
  <li>Add SCAs and MCA plots to menus in NNelement_dxp_all.adl
  <li>Add copying ROIs to SCAs in NNelement.template
</ol>
