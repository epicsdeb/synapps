<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The synApps Optics module 
</H1>
<P>The optics module contains support for devices used to modify the
x-ray beam from a synchrotron source and apply it in experimentally
useful ways, including a variety of monochromators, slits, filters,
mirrors, diffractometers, and optical tables.

<H4>Kohzu/PSL geometry 1 (Theta, Y1, Z2)</H4>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="kohzuGraphic.adl.gif" NAME="Graphic1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=452 HEIGHT=371 BORDER=0><BR>kohzuGraphic.adl</P>
<P>This MEDM display is a picture of Kohzu/PSL geometry 1, with white
beam entering from the left, monochromatized radiation diffracting
upward from the first crystal and then forward from the second
crystal. The crystal stages are mounted on a plate which rotates
about a point midway, vertically, between the incident and exiting
beam. 
</P>
<P>The difference in height between the incident beam and the point
about which the plate rotates is called the monochromator offset, and
the software allows this offset to be changed by a knowledgeable
developer, though not by the casual user. (Note that users sometimes
use 'offset' to mean the vertical distance between the incident and
exit beams, which is twice the offset as defined here.) The crystals
normally translate, as the plate rotates, to keep the first crystal
in the incident beam, and to maintain the exiting beam at constant
height. 
</P>
<P>As the monochromator rotates from a Bragg angle ('Theta&quot;) of
zero, the first crystal moves away from the rotation point along a
line normal to its diffracting planes, executing the equation 
</P>
<UL>
	<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Y = -offset/cos(Theta).</PRE>
</UL>
<P><BR>Thus, <CODE>Y(Theta=0) = -offset</CODE>, and a positive- sense
motion would move the crystal toward the rotation point. 
</P>
<P>At the same time, the second crystal moves toward the rotation
point along a line which is parallel to the crystal's diffracting
planes, and which intersects the rotation point, according to the
equation 
</P>
<UL>
	<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Z = offset/sin(Theta).</PRE>
</UL>
<P><BR>Thus, a positive-sense motion of the second crystal moves it
in the direction of the exiting beam. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because the Y and Z motions are
nonlinear functions of Theta, their speeds ideally should vary as
they move. The software doesn't attempt this, but it does attempt to
set motor speeds to the closest linear approximation to ideal
behavior. This means that it attempts to set motor speeds so that
Theta, Y, and Z all move for the same length of time. The attempt may
not succeed, however, because the motors have high and low speed
limits, and will refuse commands to violate them.

<BR>kohzuSeqCtl_All.adl</P>
<P>This MEDM display serves both geometries, and contains all of the
user-modifiable fields that control and set them up. Smaller, less
complicated displays are also provided. 
</P>
<P>At top left, crystal parameters are selected from a list that
includes Silicon (at room temperature, and at 77K), Germanium, and
Diamond. Miller indices can also be specified. When fields in this
section are modified, the resulting reflection is checked, and the
software is put into Manual-Move mode (described below). 
</P>
<P>The monochromator can be driven in energy, wavelength, or angle.
Undriven fields are kept consistent automatically with driven fields.
</P>
<P>The software can be in Manual-Move, or Auto_Move mode. In
Manual-Move mode, changes to energy, wavelength, or theta are not
sent to the motors until the user issues a &quot;Move&quot; command.
In Auto_Move mode, changes to energy, wavelength, or theta are sent
to the motors without further prompting from the user. 
</P>
<P>The manner in which 'Y', and 'Z' motions of monochromator crystals
are calculated depends on the setting of a second mode switch, with

<H4>High-resolution double-crystal (Theta<SUB>1</SUB>, Theta<SUB>2</SUB>)</H4>
<P>synApps currently supports two geometries of a high
energy-resolution, dispersive double crystal monochromator. Both
geometries actually employ four crystals, but two of the crystals are
channel-cut partners of the other two, and therefore are not driven.
Crystal angles for these monochromators are described and controlled
with three sets of variables:

<P>This display is a cartoon of the nested high-resolution
monochromator geometry, defining the meanings of the angles Theta and
Phi. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this diagram, the crystals are drawn
as if their diffracting planes were parallel to the crystal surface.
This is not always the case in actual practice, particularly for the
first crystal of the nested geometry, which typically is
asymmetrically cut to match the incident beam divergence to the
angular range over which the second crystal accepts a monochromatic
beam. Asymmetrically cut crystals will diffract at slightly different
angles than symmetrically cut crystals, because the entrance and exit
beams will be refracted by different amounts. The control software
does not take index-of-refraction effects into account. 
</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="hrSeqCtl_All_nested.adl.gif" NAME="Graphic7" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=662 HEIGHT=341 BORDER=0>
<BR>hrSeqCtl_All.adl (nested geometry) 
</P>
<P>This is the full control display for a high-resolution
monochromator in the &quot;nested&quot; geometry. At top left are
energy and wavelength drive areas, with columns of numbers in the
standard form for motors. From the top: HighLimit, Readback, Drive,
LowLimit, and Tweak. In the middle are the crystal parameters and
Bragg-angle drive area for the first crystal, 'TH1' (i.e., the
crystal surface that the beam hits first, and its channel-cut pair,
if any). At right are the crystal parameters and drive area for the
second crystal, 'TH2'. The software makes sure all these fields are
consistent with each other, so you can control the monochromator with
any of them. 
</P>
<P>High and low limits of energy, wavelength, and the Bragg angles
are calculated from limits of the motors that actually drive
crystals, the Phi1 and Phi2 motors. These motors have engineering
units of microradians, and may have small angular ranges about an
offset angle that the software calculates but needn't be able to read
or drive. The software simply assumes, for example, that when Phi1 is
at zero, the Phi1 crystal is oriented at the displayed offset angle. 
</P>
<P>Below the heavy black line is the connection between calculated
Bragg angles and actual crystal motions. When a change is made to any
of energy, wavelength, or Bragg angle, the software reconciles all
the other values, according to the mode (&quot;Theta1 only&quot;;
&quot;Theta1 and Theta2&quot;; &quot;Rock Theta2&quot;) switch, and
calculates the actual crystal angles (Phi1, Phi2) required to achieve
the new Bragg angles. These new crystal angles are displayed in the
bottom row of values under the &quot;Phi 1&quot; and &quot;Phi 2&quot;
headings. If the &quot;calibration&quot; switch is set to &quot;Use&quot;,
new Phi-motor drive values are calculated from the Phi values, by
subtracting the offsets and converting from degrees to microradians.
If the &quot;Calibrate&quot; switch is set to &quot;Set&quot;, the
offsets are calculated from the new Phi values and the existing motor
positions. 
</P>
<P>After new Phi-motor values have been calculated, they are adjusted
by the &quot;world&quot; offset, an arbitrary angle by which the user
can allow for small shifts in the incident beam angle. 
</P>
<P>When new, adjusted Phi-motor values have been calculated, they are
displayed in the orange &quot;Motor Write&quot; row under the &quot;Phi
1&quot; and &quot;Phi 2&quot; headings. If the &quot;Manual&quot;/Auto&quot;
switch is set to &quot;Auto&quot;, the new values will also be
written to the motors. If the &quot;Manual&quot;/Auto&quot; switch is
set to &quot;Manual&quot;, this will happen only when the &quot;Move&quot;
button is pressed.
