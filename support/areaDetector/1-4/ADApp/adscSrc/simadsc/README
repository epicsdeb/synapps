This directory contains simadsc (simadsc.*), a library providing a simulation
of the control of an ADSC detector.

This directory also contains header files (detcon_*.h) from the ADSC
detcon_lib_th library.  When using the ADSC detcon_lib_th library (to control
a real detector), the header files included with it should be used, not these.

The ADSC detcon_lib_th header files here were copied from the following
locations in the ADSC detector control software package:

  src_std/detcon_lib_th/detcon_entry.h
  src_std/incl/detcon_par.h
  src_std/incl/detcon_state.h
