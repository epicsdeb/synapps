.IR "\ directory" ]
.RB [ \-o\c
.IR "\ output" ]

.IR "\ separator" ]
.I "\ mdafile\ "
.RI [ "mdafile" \ [ "..." ]]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mda2ascii
is a utility for converting the binary MDA data files (created by
.BR saveData \ in
.BR EPICS )
into ASCII output.  It can handle arbitrary dimensional scans, and
splits multi-dimensional scans into separate one-dimensional scans.
One-dimensional scan values are put into column form, while the
rest of the information to the scan are kept in a commented header.
.PP
In addition to options, 
.B mda2ascii
expects the names of the MDA files to convert
.RI ( "mdafile ..." ).
By default, it writes the output for each MDA file to a single file
for a one-dimensional scan.  For multi-dimensional scans it writes
multiple files corresponding to each one-dimensional scan.  The files
are put into the current directory.  The name of the written file(s)
are determined from the input file name, where the extension is
removed and replaced with "asc".  For multiple files, the
higher-dimensional indices are added in order to the base file name.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 
.B -h
Shows the help screen.
.TP 
.B -m
Merge the higher dimensional data into the first dimensional
scan values.  Each of the higher dimensional values takes the form
of a column with that single value.  If
.B -m
is used, the higher dimensional values are removed from the header.
.TP
.B -t
Trim off all the commented header lines, leaving only values.
.TP
.B -1
For a multi-dimensional scan, all the resulting one-dimensional scans
are merged into a single output file.  An overall header is added at
the start of the file, and the scans are all separated by dividers.
.TP
.BI -x \ extension
Change the extension used for automatically naming files.
The default is "asc".
.TP
.BI -d \ directory
Change the output directory when automatically naming files.
The default is the current directory (or ".").
.TP
.BI -o \ output
Specify the output file, limiting the number of input MDA files to
one. Either the entire file name and path can be specified, or simply
the name's base.  If using a base, an extension and directory will be
appended to it, coming either from the
.B -x
and 
.B -d
options or their defaults).  Alternatively, if "\c
.B \-\c
" is specified, the output will be redirected to the standard output
(the screen).
.TP
.BI -c \ commenter
Change the string used at the beginning of a comment line.  Normally,
this is a single character, but it can be more. The default is "#".
.TP
.BI -s \ separator
Change the string used to separate the data values into columns.
The default is " ".

.SH EXAMPLES
To convert a directory full of MDA files, sending the output to the
directory "asc_data", one would simply run
.IP
\fCmda2ascii -d asc_data *.mda\fP
.LP
Alternatively, you can go into the "asc_data" directory and run instead
.IP
\fCmda2ascii ../*.mda\fP
.LP
where all the ASCII files go into the current directory.
.PP
If your program needs "%" as the comment character and "," as data
separators, you could convert the data this way, running
.IP
\fCmda2ascii -s "," -c "%" *.mda\fP
.LP
where the output goes into the original directory.
.PP
Suppose one wants all the resultant ASCII data from a
multi-dimensional data file (say "data.mda") to come out in a
multidimensional form, suitable for a matrix manipulating program.
This can be accomplished using
.IP
\fCmda2ascii -m1t -o data-matrix.dat data.mda\fP
.LP
where the output is stored in a special file "data-matrix.dat".  This
file will have the complete multi-dimensional data set ready to be
read.  There is a caveat to this:
.B "mda2ascii"
does absolutely no checking to make sure that the parameters of the
lower dimensional scans weren't altered while the top-most dimensional
scan was running.  In theory, the one-dimensional scans could have
different numbers of detectors, different number of scan points, etc.
which would make the data nonsensical.  This is very unlikely, but it
is theoretically possible.
