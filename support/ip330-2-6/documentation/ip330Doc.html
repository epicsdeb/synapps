<p>The support for the Ip330 is very general and flexible. It is
based on a 2-layer model. At the lower level is <a href="#Ip330">class
Ip330</a> which knows how to talk to the IP330 hardware, but is
application independent. Above class Ip330 are the
application-specific classes. There are currently 3 such classes:&nbsp;
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="#Ip330Scan">Ip330Scan</a> - scanning A/D
        converter application </li>
    <li><a href="#Ip330Sweep">Ip330Sweep</a> - waveform
        recorder/transient digitizer application </li>
    <li><a href="#Ip330PID">Ip330PID</a> - fast PID (feedback)
        application </li>
</ul>

<p>Ip330Scan, Ip330Sweep, and Ip330PID can all be running
simultaneously, and can even all be talking to the same input
channels. It is easy to add additional application-specific
classes as the need arises. </p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="Ip330">Class Ip330</a></h2>

<p>At the lowest level there is a class called Ip330. This class
knows how to talk to the IP330 hardware, but does not know how it
will be used. The only parameters of the IP330 module which are
not configurable in this class are the output data format (which
is set to Straight Binary) and the Interrupt Control (which is
set to interrupt after conversion of all selected channels). All
other parameters of the IP330 can be configured (first and last
channels to convert, scan mode, scan rate, trigger signal
direction, etc.) An Ip330Config server is provided together with
device support for modifying configuration parameters. Currently
it only provides the ability to specify the time between calibrations.
MPF servers and EPICS device
support exist for the application-specific classes which sit
above Ip330. </p>

<h3>Ip330 public interface</h3>

<p>This is the public interface of the Ip330 class: </p>

<pre>class Ip330
{
public:
    static Ip330 * init(
        const char *moduleName, const char *carrierName, const char *siteName,
        const char *type, const char *range, int firstChan, int lastChan,
        int maxClients, int intVec);
    int config(scanModeType scanMode, const char *triggerString, int
        microSecondsPerScan, int secondsBetweenCalibrate);
    int getCorrectedValue(int channel);
    int correctValue(int channel, int raw);
    int getRawValue(int channel);
    int setGain(int gain,int channel);
    int setScanMode(scanModeType scanMode);
    int setTrigger(triggerType trigger);
    float setMicroSecondsPerScan(float microSeconds);
    float getMicroSecondsPerScan();
    void setSecondsBetweenCalibrate(int seconds);
    int registerCallback(Ip330Callback callback, void *pvt);
</pre>

<p>Brief description of these functions: </p>

<ul>
    <li><tt>init()</tt> and <tt>config()</tt> are called from <tt>initIp330</tt>
        and <tt>configIp330</tt> which are discussed below. </li>
    <li><tt>getRawValue()</tt> returns the A/D value for a
        channel without applying the calibration corrections for
        slope and offset. </li>
    <li><tt>getCorrectedValue()</tt> returns the A/D value for a
        channel after applying the calibration corrections for
        slope and offset.
        NOTE: If secondsBetweenCalibrate is less than zero then the raw
        A/D value is returned.
        </li>
    <li><tt>correctValue()</tt> corrects an input raw value for a
        channel by applying the calibration corrections for slope
        and offset.
        NOTE: If secondsBetweenCalibrate is less than zero then the raw
        A/D value is returned.
        </li>
    <li><tt>setGain()</tt> sets the gain for a channel. The
        specified gain must be {0, 1, 2, or 3} corresponding to
        gains of {1, 2, 4, 8}. At initialization the gain of each channel
        is set to 0 and the channel calibrated.
        </li>
    <li><tt>setScanMode()</tt> sets the scan mode of the IP330.
        The scan modes are defined symbolically in <tt>Ip330.h</tt>.
        The most commonly used mode is <tt>burstContinuous</tt>,
        which digitizes all channels from firstChan to lastChan
        at 15 microseconds per channel, and then repeats this at
        an interval controlled by <tt>setMicroSecondsPerScan()</tt>.
    </li>
    <li><tt>setTrigger()</tt> sets the direction of the external
        trigger signal on the IP330 (input or output). The
        trigger directions are defined symbolically in <tt>Ip330.h</tt>.
    </li>
    <li><tt>setMicroSecondsPerScan()</tt> sets the number of
        microseconds per scan loop of the IP330. This time is
        only applicable when the scanMode is <tt>burstContinuous</tt>,
        <tt>uniformContinuous</tt>, or <tt>uniformSingle</tt>.
        This time will be the time between interrupts. It is
        automatically corrected for the 15 microsecond per
        channel conversion time of the IP330. The minimum value
        is equal to <tt>15*(lastChan-firstChan+1)</tt>. </li>
    <li><tt>getMicroSecondsPerScan()</tt> returns the number of
        microseconds per scan loop of the IP330. This value may
        not equal the requested time either because the requested
        time was too short or too long, or because of the
        granularity of the IP330 timer. </li>
    <li><tt>setSecondsBetweenCalibrate()</tt>
        When secondsBetweenCalibrate is given a value
        <ul>
            <li>greater than zero,
                then all channels are calibrated every secondsBetweenCalibrate
                seconds.</li>
            <li>equal to zero, then all channels are calibrated once.</li>
            <li>less than zero then no calibration 
                is done. In addition getCorrectedValue and correctValue both
                return the raw rather than converted value.</li>
        </ul>
    <li><tt>registerCallback()</tt> This function is called by
        application-specific classes to register their interrupt
        functions with Ip330. Ip330 will call the registered
        function every time an interrupt occurs, passing the <tt>pvt</tt>
        pointer, and a pointer to the new data. The <tt>pvt</tt>
        pointer is typically a pointer to the application class
        object. The Ip330 interrupt routine does the following: <ul>
            <li>Saves the floating point context so application
                interrupt functions can do floating point
                operations. </li>
            <li>Copies the data from the mailBox registers to a
                local buffer. </li>
            <li>Calls the interrupt function in each registered
                application class, passing the <tt>pvt</tt>
                pointer, and a pointer to the local copy of the
                data. </li>
            <li>Restores the floating point context. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Ip330 configuration</h3>

<p>The Ip330 is configured by calling the following functions
from the vxWorks startup file. </p>

<pre>extern &quot;C&quot; Ip330 *initIp330(
    const char *moduleName, const char *carrierName, const char *siteName,
    const char *typeString, const char *rangeString,
    int firstChan, int lastChan,
    int maxClients, int intVec)

# function return value  = pointer to the Ip330 object, needed by configIp330
#                          and to initialize the application-specific classes
# moduleName  = name to give this module
# carrierName = name of IPAC carrier from initIpacCarrier
# siteName    = name of IP site, e.g. &quot;IP_a&quot;
# typeString  = &quot;D&quot; or &quot;S&quot; for differential or single-ended
# rangeString = &quot;-5to5&quot;,&quot;-10to10&quot;,&quot;0to5&quot;, or &quot;0to10&quot;
#               This value must match hardware setting selected with DIP switches
# firstChan   = first channel to be digitized.  This must be in the range:
#               0 to 31 (single-ended)
#               0 to 15 (differential)
# lastChan    = last channel to be digitized
# maxClients =  Maximum number of Ip330 tasks which will attach to this
#               Ip330 module.  For example Ip330Scan, Ip330Sweep, etc.  This
#               does not refer to the number of EPICS clients.  A value of
#               10 should certainly be safe.
# intVec        Interrupt vector

extern &quot;C&quot; int configIp330(
    Ip330 *pIp330,
    scanModeType scanMode, const char *triggerString,
    int microSecondsPerScan, int secondsBetweenCalibrate)

# pIp330      = pointer to the Ip330 object, returned by initIp330 above
# scanMode    = scan mode:
#               0 = disable
#               1 = uniformContinuous
#               2 = uniformSingle
#               3 = burstContinuous (normally recommended)
#               4 = burstSingle
#               5 = convertOnExternalTriggerOnly
# triggerString = &quot;Input&quot; or &quot;Output&quot;. Selects the direction of the external
#               trigger signal.
# microSecondsPerScan = repeat interval to digitize all channels
#               The minimum theoretical time is 15 microseconds times the
#               number of channels, but a practical limit is probably 100
#               microseconds.  Larger values reduce CPU usage, but decrease
#               the number of callbacks per second to the application classes.
#               This will reduce the number of measurement averages in the
#               ip330Scan class,  increase the granularity in the time per
#               point for the ip330Sweep class, and decrease the number of
#               feedback cycles per second for the ip330PID class.
# secondsBetweenCalibrate = number of seconds between calibration cycles.
#               If zero then there will be no periodic calibration, but
#               one calibration will still be done at initialization.
#               If less than zero then no calibration is done.
#               NOTE: setGain() also causes a calibration.
</pre>

<p>Note that the reason for having <tt>configIp330</tt>, rather
than just <tt>initIp330</tt> is simply that there are more than
10 configurable parameters, but vxWorks only allows 10 arguments
to be passed to functions which are called from the shell. </p>

<h3>IP330 Hardware setup</h3>

<p>The DIP Switch Settings column correspond to the value of
switches 1 - 10. A value of 1011000010 corresponds to switches
1,3,4,9 on and 2,5,6,7,8,10 off. </p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="Ip330Config">Ip330Config Server</a></h2>

<p>A server and device support are provided to dynamically
change configuration values. Currently this only provides support for
changing setSecondsBetweenCalibrate.

<h3>Ip330Config server configuration</h3>

<pre>extern &quot;C&quot; int initIp330Config(
    Ip330 *pIp330, const char *serverName, int queueSize)
# pIp330     = pointer returned by initIp330 above
# serverName = name to give this server.  Must match the INP parm field in
#              EPICS records
# queueSize  = size of output queue for MPF. Make this the maximum number 
#              of records attached to this server.
</pre>

<h3>Ip330Config EPICS Device Support</h3>

<p> The current device support is for a longout record.
It sends an Int32Messages with the following info: </p>

<ul>
    <li><tt>cmd</tt></li>
    <li><tt>value</tt></li>
</ul>

<p>Server returns: </p>

<ul>
    <li><tt>status</tt> - 0 means success; </li>
</ul>

<p>Standard output record type format is for longout records </p>

<pre> field(DTYP,&quot;ip330Config&quot;)

 field(OUT,&quot;#C{card} S{signal} @{servername},{cmd}
 card   =       The location of the server
 signal =       Not currently used. Just make the value 0
 servername     Must match the serverName specified with initIp330Config
 cmd		Default is 0,which for now is the only valid value.

 field(VAL)     When the record is processed the value of the VAL field
                is setSecondsBetweenCalibrate. See above for meaning.
</pre>
A typical use is to have a passive longout record.
If the VAL field is 0, then each time the record is processed calibration
will be performed.

<h2 align="center"><a name="Ip330Scan">Class Ip330Scan</a></h2>

<p>This class provides the functions of an averaging A/D converter.
Together with class Ip330 it provides the same functionality as
Ip330ScanApp in previous releases of MPF. </p>

<h3>Ip330Scan public interface</h3>

<p>This is the public interface of the Ip330Scan class: </p>

<pre>class Ip330Scan
{
public:
    Ip330Scan(Ip330 *pIp330, int firstChan, int lastChan);
    int getValue(int channel);
    int setGain(int gain,int channel);
</pre>

<p>Brief description of these functions: </p>

<ul>
  <li><tt>Ip330Scan</tt>();<br>
      <tt>getValue()</tt> returns the averaged A/D value for a
        channel. This value is corrected for slope and offset
        using the calibration data. This is the value returned to
        EPICS by Ip330ScanServer.</li>
  <li><tt>setGain()</tt> sets the gain for this channel. See <tt>Ip330::setGain()</tt>
        for more information.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Ip330Scan configuration</h3>

<pre>extern &quot;C&quot; int initIp330Scan(
    Ip330 *pIp330, const char *serverName, int firstChan, int lastChan, int queueSize)
# pIp330     = pointer returned by initIp330 above
# serverName = name to give this server.  Must match the INP parm field in
#              EPICS records
# firstChan  = first channel to be used by Ip330Scan.  This must be in the
#              range firstChan to lastChan specified in initIp330
# lastChan   = last channel to be used by Ip330Scan.  This must be in the range
#              firstChan to lastChan specified in initIp330
# queueSize  = size of output queue for MPF. Make this the maximum number 
#              of ai records attached to this server.
</pre>

<p>Note that the &quot;millisecondsToAverage&quot; argument which was present in
releases prior to 1.6 has been removed because the averaging algorithm has
changed.</p>

<h3>Ip330Scan EPICS Device Support</h3>

<p>Device support sends Int32Messages with the following info: </p>

<ul>
    <li><tt>address</tt> - channel </li>
    <li><tt>value</tt> - gain </li>
</ul>

<p>Server returns: </p>

<ul>
    <li><tt>value</tt> as 32 bit unsigned integer from 0 to
        0xffff </li>
    <li><tt>status</tt> 0 means success; </li>
</ul>

<p>Note that sending the value returned by the server is the average from the
time the previous message was sent until this message was sent.&nbsp; In other
words, sending a message returns the current average and resets the average (sum
and counter).</p>

<p>Standard input record type format is for ai records </p>

<pre> field(SCAN,&quot;1 second&quot;)

 field(DTYP,&quot;ip330Scan&quot;)

                Differential inputs 0 - 15 are valid
                Single ended inputs 0 - 31 are valid
 servername     Must match the serverName specified with initIp330Scan
 gain           Optional. If given must be 0,1,2,or 3. Default is 0.

 Mandatory
</pre>

<h2 align="center"><a name="Ip330Sweep">Class Ip330Sweep</a></h2>

<p>This class provides a waveform recorder or transient
digitizer, i.e. it collects voltage as a function of time. Time
increments as short as 100 microseconds are possible if one does
not use all of the channels. </p>

<h3>Ip330Sweep public interface</h3>

<p>Ip330Sweep is a subclass of fastSweep, which is an abstract base class.&nbsp;
This is the public interface of the Ip330Sweep class: </p>

<pre>class Ip330Sweep
{
public:
    ip330Sweep(Ip330 *pIp330, int firstChan, int lastChan, int maxPoints);
    void startAcquire();
    void stopAcquire();
    void erase();
    double setMicroSecondsPerPoint(double microSeconds);
    double getMicroSecondsPerPoint();
    void nextPoint(int *newData)
    int setNumPoints(int numPoints);
    int getNumPoints();
    int setRealTime(double time);
    int setLiveTime(double time);
    double getElapsedTime();
    int getStatus();
    void getData(int channel, int *data); 
    int firstChan;
    int lastChan;
</pre>

<p>Ip330Sweep is a more complex application than Ip330Scan. It
acquires waveform data into a local buffer, which can be returned
to EPICS. Waveform acquisition is started by <tt>startAcquire</tt>.
Acquisition stops whenever one of the following occurs: </p>

<ul>
    <li>The preset time set with <tt>setPresetTime()</tt> is
        reached. </li>
    <li>The preset number of waveform points set with <tt>setNumPoints()</tt>
        is reached. </li>
    <li>Acquisition is explicitly stopped by calling <tt>stopAcquire()</tt>.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Ip330Sweep can acquire multiple waveforms simultaneously, one
for each of the input channels. Acquisition is started and
stopped for all channels simultaneously, and <tt>erase()</tt>
erases all waveforms. </p>

<p>Brief description of these functions: </p>

<ul>
    <li><tt>ip330Sweep</tt> is called from <tt>initIp330Sweep</tt>
        which is discussed below. </li>
    <li><tt>setGain()</tt> sets the gain for this channel. See <tt>Ip330::setGain()</tt>
        for more information. </li>
    <li><tt>startAcquire()</tt> starts acquiring points. </li>
    <li><tt>stopAcquire()</tt> stops acquiring points. </li>
    <li><tt>erase()</tt> erases the waveform. This sets all of
        the waveform data to 0, sets the elapsed time to 0, and
        resets the next channel pointer to 0. </li>
    <li><tt>setMicroSecondsPerPoint()</tt> sets the time interval
        between waveform points. The actual time interval will be
        an integer multiple of the value of <tt>microSecondsPerScan</tt>
        specified in the call to <tt>configIp330</tt>. </li>
    <li><tt>getMicroSecondsPerPoint()</tt> gets the actual time
        interval between waveform points. The actual time
        interval may not be equal to the time interval requested
        with <tt>setMicroSecondsPerPoint()</tt>, because the
        actual time must be an integer multiple of the value of <tt>microSecondsPerScan</tt>
        specified in the call to <tt>configIp330</tt>. </li>
    <li><tt>setNumPoints()</tt> sets the number of points to be
        acquired in the waveform. This value must be less than <tt>maxPoints</tt>
        specified in the call to <tt>initIp330Sweep()</tt>. </li>
    <li><tt>getNumPoints()</tt> gets the number of points to be
        acquired in the waveform. </li>
    <li><tt>setRealTime()</tt> sets the maximum acquisition
        time in seconds. The vxWorks system clock is used for
        this timing, so the resolution is typically 1/50 or 1/60
        of a second. The preset time is ignored if it is zero. </li>
    <li><tt>setLiveTime()</tt> sets the maximum acquisition
        time in seconds. The vxWorks system clock is used for
        this timing, so the resolution is typically 1/50 or 1/60
        of a second. The preset time is ignored if it is zero. </li>
    <li><tt>getElapsedTime()</tt> returns the elapsed acquisition
        time in seconds. The elapsed time is reset to zero when <tt>erase()</tt>
        is called. The vxWorks system clock is used for this
        timing, so the resolution is typically 1/50 or 1/60 of a
        second. </li>
    <li><tt>getStatus()</tt> returns the acquisition status, 1 if
        the unit is acquiring a waveform, 0 if it is not
        acquiring. </li>
    <li><tt>getData()</tt> returns the waveform data for a
        channel. </li>
</ul>

<p>Note that microSecondsPerPoint can be greater than microSecondsPerScan in
Ip330, i.e. the waveform sampling time can be an integer multiple N of the Ip330
acquisition time.&nbsp; In this case, Ip330Sweep does averaging, each point in
the waveform will be the average of N samples of the input signal.&nbsp; This
feature was introduced in release 1.7.</p>

</pre>

<h3>Ip330Sweep EPICS Device Support</h3>

<p>Device support can send the following messages (MSG_XXX are
defined in mcaApp/src/mca.h): </p>

<p>Float64Messages with the following info: </p>

<ul>
    <li><tt>cmd = MSG_ERASE</tt> - erase waveform </li>
    <li><tt>cmd = MSG_ACQUIRE</tt> - start acquisition </li>
    <li><tt>cmd = MSG_STOP_ACQUISITION</tt> - stop acquisition </li>
    <li><tt>cmd = NSG_SET_NCHAN</tt> - set number of waveform
        points <ul>
            <li><tt>value</tt> - number of channels </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><tt>cmd = MSG_READ</tt> - read data. Server returns an
        Int32ArrayMessage with the data. </li>
    <li><tt>cmd = MSG_GET_ACQ_STATUS</tt> - read status. Server
        returns a Float64ArrayMessage with the elapsed real time,
        elapsed live time, time per point and acquire status. </li>
    <li><tt>cmd = MSG_SET_DWELL</tt> - sets the time per point <ul>
            <li><tt>value</tt> - dwell time per point in seconds </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><tt>cmd = MSG_SET_LIVE_TIME</tt> - sets the preset live
        time <ul>
            <li><tt>value</tt> - preset time in seconds. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><tt>cmd = MSG_SET_REAL_TIME</tt> - sets the preset real
        time. </li>
    <li>&nbsp;<ul>
            <li><tt>value</tt> - preset time in seconds. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Preset live time and preset real time are ignored if they are
zero. There is no difference between live and real time, but
acquisition will stop whenever either preset time is reached.</p>

<p>Standard input record type format is for MCA records. Note
that the MCA record is not part of EPICS base. The MPF device
support for the MCA record, and the MCA record itself are
available separately in the <a
href="http://cars.uchicago.edu/software/pub/mcaApp.tar">mcaApp tar
file</a>. </p>

<pre> field(DTYP,&quot;MPF MCA&quot;)

 field(NMAX, nchannels)
 nchannels = maximum number of channels (time points) to use for this record.
             NMAX cannot be changed after iocInit.  NMAX should normally be 
             set to the same value specified for maxPoints in initIp330Sweep

 field(NUSE, nchannels)
 nchannels = actual number of channels (time points) to use for this record.
             NUSE can be changed at any time, however it cannot be greater 
             than NMAX or maxPoints specified in initIp330Sweep

 field(DWEL, scan_time)
 scan_time = time per point in seconds (floating point).  Values as small as
             as 1.e-4 (100 microseconds) can be used if 6 or fewer channels 
             are digitized.  The DWEL field will be set to the actual time
             per point, in case the value requested is not available either
             because it is too short or too long, or because the requested
             time was not an integer multiple of the value of 
             microSecondsPerScan specified in the call to configIp330.

 field(INP,&quot;#C{card} S{signal} @{servername})
 card   =       The location of the server
 signal =       The input channel of the ip330ADC
                Differential inputs 0 - 15 are valid
                Single ended inputs 0 - 31 are valid
 servername     Must match the serverName specified with initIp330Sweep

<h2 align="center"><a name="Ip330PID">Class Ip330PID</a></h2>

<p>This class provides very fast PID (feedback) software. It
reads its input from a single channel of the Ip330 and writes its
output to a single DAC channel on the Systran DAC (<a href="http://cars.uchicago.edu/software/dac128VREADME.html">dac128V</a>). It can do feedback faster than 1 kHz. It uses exactly
the same feedback algorithm as the soft record device support in
the EPID (Enhanced PID) EPICS record. </p>

<h3>Ip330 public interface</h3>

<p>Ip330PID is a subclass of fastPID, which is an abstract base class.&nbsp; This is the public interface of the Ip330PID class: </p>

<pre>class Ip330PID
{
public:
    Ip330PID(Ip330 *pIp330, int ADCChannel, DAC128V *pDAC128V, int DACChannel);
    void doPID(double actual);
    double setMicroSecondsPerScan(double microSeconds);
    double getMicroSecondsPerScan();
    double readOutput();
    void writeOutput(double output);
    double setPoint;
    double actual;
    double error;
    double KP;
    double KI;
    double KD;
    double P;
    double I;
    double D;
    double lowLimit;
    double highLimit;
    double output;
    int feedbackOn;
    int prevFeedbackOn;
    double prevError;
</pre>

<p>This is a brief description of this public interface. The
public variables (<tt>setPoint, actual</tt>, etc.) are marked as
R/W for Read/Write or RO for Read Only. The R/W variables can be
changed by the server at any time. </p>

<ul>
    <li><tt>setMicroSecondsPerScan()</tt> sets the time per
        feedback loop. The actual time interval will be an
        integer multiple of the value of <tt>microSecondsPerScan</tt>
        specified in the call to <tt>configIp330</tt>. </li>
    <li><tt>getMicroSecondsPerScan()</tt> gets the actual time
        per feedback loop. The actual time interval may not be
        equal to the time interval requested with <tt>setMicroSecondsPerScan()</tt>,
        because the actual time must be an integer multiple of
        the value of <tt>microSecondsPerScan</tt> specified in
        the call to <tt>configIp330</tt>. </li>
    <li><tt>setPoint</tt> (R/W) is the desired value of the IP330
        input channel. </li>
    <li><tt>actual</tt> (RO) is the actual current value of the
        IP330 input channel. </li>
    <li><tt>error</tt> (RO) is equal to <tt>setPoint-actual</tt>.
    </li>
    <li><tt>KP</tt> (R/W) is the proportional gain. </li>
    <li><tt>KI</tt> (R/W) is the integral gain. </li>
    <li><tt>KD</tt> (R/W) is the derivative gain. </li>
    <li><tt>P</tt> (RO) is the proportional term. </li>
    <li><tt>I</tt> (R/W) is the integral term. This term is R/W
        since one may want to force it to zero or another value
        to prevent over/undershoot or to improve response time. </li>
    <li><tt>D</tt> (RO) is the derivative term. </li>
    <li><tt>lowLimit</tt> (R/W) is the lower limit on the DAC
        output. If the computed output from the PID algorithm is
        less than this value it will be set to <tt>lowLimit</tt>.
    </li>
    <li><tt>highLimit</tt> (R/W) is the high limit on the DAC
        output. If the computed output from the PID algorithm is
        greater than this value it will be set to <tt>highLimit</tt>.
    </li>
    <li><tt>output</tt> (RO) is the output value to be written to
        the DAC. If <tt>feedbackOn=0</tt> then the value will not
        actually be written to the DAC. </li>
    <li><tt>feedbackOn</tt> (R/W) is 0 is feedback is off, 1 if
        feedback is on. When feedback is off the PID calculation
        still runs, but the computed output is simply not written
        to the DAC. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Ip330PID configuration</h3>

<pre>extern &quot;C&quot; Ip330PID *initIp330PID(const char *serverName,
         Ip330 *pIp330, int ADCChannel, DAC128V *pDAC128V, int DACChannel,
         int queueSize)
# serverName = name to give this server
# pIp330     = pointer returned by initIp330 above
# ADCChannel = ADC channel to be used by Ip330PID as its readback source.  
#              This must be in the range firstChan to lastChan specified in 
#              initIp330
# pDAC128V   = pointer returned by initDAC128V
# DACChannel = DAC channel to be used by Ip330PID as its control output.  This
#              must be in the range 0-7.
# queueSize  = size of output queue for EPICS
</pre>

<p>Note that prior to release 1.7 there was an additional function,&nbsp; <tt>configIp330PID</tt>,
that was used to configure parameters such as KP, KI, etc.&nbsp; This function
has been eliminated, because it is not possible to pass floating point arguments
from the vxWorks shell on the PowerPC architecture, and because these parameters
are set at iocInit by device support anyway.&nbsp;
</p>

<h3>Ip330PID EPICS Device Support</h3>

<p>Device support sends Float64Messages with the following info: </p>

<ul>
    <li><tt>cmd = cmdStartFeedback</tt> - turn on feedback </li>
    <li><tt>cmd = cmdStopFeedback</tt> - turn off feedback </li>
    <li><tt>cmd = cmdSetLowLimit</tt> - set the low limit on the
        DAC output, <tt>value</tt> = low limit </li>
    <li><tt>cmd = cmdSetHighLimit</tt> - set the high limit on
        the DAC output, <tt>value</tt> = high limit </li>
    <li><tt>cmd = cmdSetKP</tt> - set the proportional gain, <tt>value</tt>
        = KP </li>
    <li><tt>cmd = cmdSetKI</tt> - set the integral gain, <tt>value</tt>
        = KI </li>
    <li><tt>cmd = cmdSetKD</tt> - set the derivative gain, <tt>value</tt>
        = KD </li>
    <li><tt>cmd = cmdSetI</tt> - set the integral term, <tt>value</tt>
        = I </li>
    <li><tt>cmd = cmdSetSecondsPerScan</tt> - set the time per
        feedback loop, <tt>value</tt> = time in seconds </li>
    <li><tt>cmd = cmdSetSetPoint</tt> - set the setpoint, which
        is the desired input reading from the ADC channel </li>
    <li><tt>cmd = cmdGetParams</tt> - read the current feedback
        parameters. The server returns a Float64ArrayMessage with
        the following information from Ip330PID: <ul>
            <li><tt>actual</tt>, ADC input </li>
            <li><tt>error</tt>, setPoint-actual </li>
            <li><tt>P</tt>, proportional term </li>
            <li><tt>I</tt>, integral term </li>
            <li><tt>D</tt>, derivative term </li>
            <li><tt>output</tt>, computed output, which is the
                value written to the DAC if feedback is on. </li>
            <li><tt>secondsPerScan</tt>, actual seconds per
                feedback loop. This may differ from the requested
                time because it was too long or too short, or
                because the requested time was not an integer
                multiple of the value of <tt>microSecondsPerScan</tt>
                specified in the call to <tt>configIp330</tt>. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Standard input record type format is for EPID records. Note
that the EPID record is not part of EPICS base. The EPID record is available from Mark
Rivers or from the APS Beamline Controls and Data Acquisition
group. </p>

<pre> field(DTYP,&quot;MPF EPID&quot;)

 field(INP,&quot;#C{card} S0 @{servername})
 card   =       The location of the server
 servername     Must match the serverName specified with initIp330PID

 field(SCAN,&quot;.1 second&quot;)
           = interval process the record.  Each time the EPID record processes
             it sends any new parameters (KI, KP, KD, setPoint, etc.) and
             reads back the parameters from the server (P, I, D, error, output,
             etc.)  Thus if SCAN=.1 second then the EPID record provides 10 Hz
             snapshots of the PID feedback, which may actually be occuring at
             1 kHz or faster.  The Ip330Sweep support can be used together with
             the EPICS MCA record to capture the actual ADC input as fast as it
             is digitized, so the complete error information is available.

 field(KP, kp)
 kp        = proportional gain

 field(KI, ki)
 ki        = integral gain

 field(KD, kd)
 kd        = derivative gain

 field(DT, scan_time)
 scan_time = time per feedback loop in seconds

 field(VAL, setPoint)
 setPoint = setpoint in IP330 ADC units

 field(DRVL, lowLimit)
 lowLimit = low output limit in DAC128CV DAC units

 field(DRVH, highLimit)
 highLimit = high output limit in DAC128CV DAC units
</pre>

<h2 align="center"><a name="Restriction">Restrictions on Scan
Timing</a></h2>

<p>In an earlier release of this package (1.0) each of the
application-specific classes (Ip330Scan, Ip330Sweep, Ip330PID)
had a function to control the scan rate of the Ip330. However,
there is only a single interval timer in the IP330 hardware, and
so if one class changed the scan rate it would change the scan
rate for all of the other classes. This interaction was
undesirable, and so the behavior was changed, starting with
release 1.01. The value of <tt>microSecondsPerScan</tt>
specified in <tt>configIp330</tt> is never changed by any
application classes. Each application class will have its
callback routine executed at this time interval. The application
class will determine what to do when it is called back. For
example, in the <tt>ip330Sweep</tt> class if <tt>microSecondsPerPoint</tt>
is 1000, and <tt>ip330-&gt;microSecondsPerScan</tt> is 500, then
the <tt>ip330Sweep</tt> callback routine returns immediately
without doing anything on every other call. This behavior
eliminates any interaction between the timing for the different
application classes. The limitation is that the granularity
of the time intervals available to an application class is now
limited to the value of <tt>microSecondsPerScan</tt> specified in
<tt>configIp330</tt>, whereas previously the granularity was 8
microseconds. Thus, for example, if <tt>microSecondsPerScan</tt>
is 500 microseconds then the dwell times available in the <tt>ip330Sweep</tt>
class are limited to multiples of 500 microseconds. </p>
