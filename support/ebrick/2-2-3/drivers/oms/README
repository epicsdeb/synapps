            Pro-dex OMS motion controller Linux Device Driver
                            October 4, 2006

    This device driver was written by David Kline of the ANL/APS
    BCDA group. It was derived from the example driver as presented
    in "Linux Device Drivers, 3th Edition" by Jonathan Corbet,
    Alessandro Rubini, and Greg Kroah-Hartman.

    The files contained in the distribution are as follows:
        Makefile    - Used to build the driver and application.
        oms.c       - OMS device driver.
        oms.h       - Include files for driver and application.
        omstest.c   - Test application.
        rc.oms      - Script for loading the driver and creating
                      the device files. The file should be placed
                      in /etc/rc.d and called from rc.local.
        README      - This file.

    Notes:
        1. The driver has been written for the 2.6.x kernel.
        2. Interrupts are supported.
