            Onyx-MM-XT 48bit Digital IO Linux Device Driver
                            February 14, 2008

    This device driver was written by David Kline of the ANL/APS
    BCDA group. It was derived from the example driver as presented
    in "Linux Device Drivers, 3th Edition" by Jonathan Corbet,
    Alessandro Rubini, and Greg Kroah-Hartman.

    The files contained in the distribution are as follows:
        Makefile    - Used to build the driver and application.
        omm.c       - OMM device driver.
        omm.h       - Include files for driver and application.
        ommtest.c   - Test application.
        ommmon.c    - Test application to monitor interrupts.
        rc.omm      - Script for loading the driver and creating
                      the device files. The file should be placed
                      in /etc/rc.d and called from rc.local.
        README      - This file.

    Notes:
        1. The driver has been written for the 2.6.x kernel.
        2. Interrupts are supported.
