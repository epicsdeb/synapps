                    EBRICK LINUX DEVICE DRIVERS
                    ===========================

These directories contain the sources for the Linux device drivers developed to
service interrupts from the associated hardware and serve as utilites to
facilitate development.

Directories:
    autoshut - The auto-shutdown feature used only on the Athena platform. It
               uses the parallel port to generate an interrupt to gracefully
               perform a shutdown.
    omm      - Supports interrupts generated by the Onyx-MM-XT modules supplied
               by Diamond Systems (part OMM-XT). Typically used in conjunction
               with the BC-059 board for the Scaler application.
    oms      - Supports interrupts and read/write functionality for the Pro-dex
               OMS PC68-46 Motion Controller PC/104 module.
    utils    - Provides utility applications for IO port read/write accesses
               as well as serial-link functionality employed by the BC-059
               Scaler.

These applications are typically ran as root. However, they can be invoked at
user-level by calling them as a parameter to the launch application.
