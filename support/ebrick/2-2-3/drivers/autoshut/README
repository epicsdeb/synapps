            EPICS Brick Automatic Shutdown Linux Device Driver
                            October 27, 2006

    This device driver was written by David Kline of the ANL/APS
    BCDA group. It was derived from the example driver as presented
    in "Linux Device Drivers, 3th Edition" by Jonathan Corbet,
    Alessandro Rubini, and Greg Kroah-Hartman.

    The files contained in the distribution are as follows:
        Makefile    - Used to build the driver and application.
        autoshut.c  - Linux device driver.
        autoshut.h  - Include files for driver and application.
        asmon.c     - Interrupt monitoring application.
        astest.c    - Test application
        rc.autoshut - Script for loading the driver.
        README      - This file.

    Notes:
        1. The driver has been written for the 2.6.x kernel.
        2. At this time, it only can be used with the parallel port.
        3. The rc.autoshut file should be placed in /etc/rc.d and
           called from rc.local.
        4. The file asmon should be called from rc.local passing
           the device file name (i.e. /dev/autoshut).
