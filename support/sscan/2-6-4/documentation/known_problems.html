<h1>sscan 2-5-5</h1>
<ul>
<li>saveData was writing scan dimensions to the wrong offset in the data file
header, under some circumstances, corrupting the header so that some readers
could not understand the file.
</li>
<li>Prefix length was inconsistently enforced, with the result that the maximum
number of characters (exclusing the trailing null) was actually eight, instead
of nine.  </li>
</ul>

<h1>sscan 2-5-4</h1>
<ul>
<li>scanSee (a display program not included in the sscan module) gets confused
because saveData's messages to users have been reformatted.  </li>
<li>the sscan record does not behave correctly if autosave restores an
illegal value for NPTS.</li>
</ul>

<h1>sscan 2-5-3</h1>
<ul>
<li>Scans hang if the data-file fails.  </li>
</ul>

<h1>sscan 2-5-2</h1>
<ul>
<li>Scans can hang because of a race condition in doPuts() and a
call to recDynLinkPutCallback() that failed for a reason other
than notifyInProgress.  </li>
</ul>

<h1>sscan 2-4</h1>
<ul>
<li>The before-scan link (.BSPV, .BSCD) is broken.</li>
<li>If a PV link is changed while the previous value is still
connecting, the software will hang.
</ul>
