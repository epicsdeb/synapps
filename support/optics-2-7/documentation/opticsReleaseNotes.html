<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>optics Release Notes</H1>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Release 2-7</H2>
<ul>
<li>SGM.db had some empty links that were specified as "0", which produced link errors.
<li>table_setup_PNC.adl showed origin in wrong position (at M1, instead of M0).
<li>Added database and MEDM displays for a multilayer monochromator.
<li>2slit.db, 2postMirror.db - Added DMOV PV, implemented using local gate PV.
<li>Added fb_epid.db and fb_epid.adl: user-reconfigurable software feedback
	using the epid record, and related documentation fb_epid/*.
<li>Added sncqxbpm.st, qxbpm.db, qxbpm.req, qxbpm*.adl -  Support for the Oxford
	4-channel X-ray Beam Position Monitor, and related documentation qxbpm.html.
<li>xia-slit.db - Modified for update slit support
<li>seqPVmacros.h - format changes
<li>tableRecord.c - commented out unused variables
</ul>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Release 2-6-1</H2>
<ul>
<li>Added support for a multilayer monochromator
<li>XIA_shutter.db  - user command was sometimes overwritten by a poll and dropped
</ul>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Release 2-6</H2>
<UL>
<li>New support for XIA PF4 filter/shutter: rewritten to use asyn records
instead of stringin/out records with stringParm device support.  Also waitTime
calc (for serial record) was in milliseconds, but the serial record was
replaced by an asyn record, whose timeout is specified in seconds.
Database converted to vdct.
<li>Oxford 4-channel x-ray beam position monitor
<li>New support for an ASRP optical table
<li>optics/opticsApp/Db/2slit.db: deleted gate-related  PV's
<li>optics/opticsApp/Db/table.db: Fixed problems that were causing motor
records to be put into alarm: tweakVal records had UDF==1; calcout record had
empty CALC expression.
</ul>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Release 2-5-3</H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fixed problems in table.db that
	caused the table to put motors into alarm.</P>
</UL>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Release 2-5-2</H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Added MEDM display files for XIA PF4
	filter, and fixed it to compile for vxWorks</p>
	<li>xia_slit.st was not honoring limits written to the hardware.
	<li>2slit.db converted to vdct
</UL>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Release 2-5-1</H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Added CoarseFineMotor database and
	MEDM display files 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">fixed minor problems with xia_slit
	MEDM display.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Added support for XIA PF4 dual
	filters.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Added support for Io (ionization-chamber) calculation.</P>
	</UL>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Release 2-5</H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Added diffractometer support
	(orientation matrix) 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Added some documentation for
	slits, mirrors, filters, spherical grating monochromator,
	high-energy-resolution monochromator. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Ported xia slit to EPICS 3.14, and improved its behavior when
	driven by ca_put_callback(). 
	</P>
</UL>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Release 2-4</H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Added table of fixed points
	(points about which an optical table rotates) to table database,
	request file, and medm displays 
	</P>
	<LI><P>The save_restore include file, table_settings.req, now
	requires the additional macro argument 'Q'. This is the same macro
	argument required by table.db. 
	</P>
</UL>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Release 2-3</H2>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>This is the first release of the synApps optics module.
Version numbering for this module begins with 2.3 because this module
was split from version 2.2 of the std module, and I wanted to retain
the CVS histories of module contents.</P>
<P>This version is intended to build with EPICS base 3.14.5, mpf
2.4.2, and std 2.3. Differences from software as previously released
in std 2.2: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Converted to EPICS 3.14 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Docs updated and moved to
	optics/documentation 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">SGM.db - removed forward links
	pointing nowhere (gdct artifacts). 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">kohzuSeq.db - added debug PV
	$(P)KohzuCtlDebug. Fixed long-standing bug: if the theta motor was
	moved by a very small amount (by external client not working through
	kohzuCtl) this software would sometimes ignore the notification it
	received from EPICS. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>hrSeq.db - added debug PV $(P)HR$(N)CtlDebug. Fixed
	long-standing bug: if a theta motor was moved by a very small amount
	(by external client not working through hrCtl) this software would
	sometimes ignore the notification it received from EPICS.
