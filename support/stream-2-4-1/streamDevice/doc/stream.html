<h1>EPICS <em>StreamDevice</em> Documentation</h1>

<h2>What is <em>StreamDevice</em>?</h2>
<p>
<em>StreamDevice</em> is a generic
<a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics" target="ex">EPICS</a>
device support for devices with a "byte stream" based
communication interface.
That means devices that can be controlled by sending and
receiving strings (in the broadest sense, including non-printable
characters and even null-bytes). 
Examples for this type of communication interface are
serial line (RS-232, RS-485, ...),
IEEE-488 (also known as GPIB or HP-IB), and TCP/IP.
<em>StreamDevice</em> comes with an interface to<a target="ex"
href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/modules/soft/asyn/">
<em>asynDriver</em></a>
but can be extended to
<a href="businterface.html">support other bus drivers</a>.
</p>
<p>
If the device can be controlled with strings like
"<code>RF:FREQ 499.655 MHZ</code>", <em>StreamDevice</em> can be used.
How the strings exactly look like is defined in <em>protocols</em>.
Formatting and interpretation of values is done with
<a href="formats.html"><em>format converters</em></a> similar to those
known from the C functions <em>printf()</em> and <em>scanf()</em>.
To support other formats, it is possible to
<a href="formatconverter.html">write your own converters</a>.
</p>
<p>
Each record with <em>StreamDevice</em> support runs one <em>protocol</em>
to read or write its value.
All <em>protocols</em> are defined in
<a href="protocol.html"><em>protocol files</em></a> in plain ASCII text.
No compiling is necessary to change a protocol or to support new devices.
<em>Protocols</em> can be as simple as just one output string or can
consist of many strings sent to and read from the device.
However, a protocol is linear.
That means it runs from start to end each time the record is
<a href="processing.html">processed</a>.
It does not provide loops or branches.
</p>
<p>
<em>StreamDevice</em> supports all
<a href="recordtypes.html">standard records</a> of EPICS base
which can have device support.
It is also possible to
<a href="recordinterface.html">write support for new record types</a>.
</p>

<h2>What is <em>StreamDevice</em> not?</h2>
<p>
It is not a programming language for a high-level application.
It is, for example, not possible to write a complete scanning program
in a <em>protocol</em>.
Use other tools for that and use <em>StreamDevice</em> only for the
primitive commands.
</p>
<p>
It is not a block oriented device support.
It is not possible to send or receive huge blocks of data that contain
many process variables distributed over many records.
