### Start up the autosave task and tell it what to do.
# The task is actually named "save_restore".
# (See also, 'initHooks' above, which is the means by which the values that
# will be saved by the task we're starting here are going to be restored.
# Note that you can reload these sets after creating them: e.g., 
# reload_monitor_set("auto_settings.req",30,"P=as:")
#
# save positions every five seconds
create_monitor_set("auto_positions.req",5,"P=as:")
# save other things every thirty seconds
create_monitor_set("auto_settings.req",30,"P=as:")

# The following command makes the autosave request files 'info_settings.req',
# and 'info_positions.req', from information (info nodes) contained in all of
# the EPICS databases that have been loaded into this IOC.
