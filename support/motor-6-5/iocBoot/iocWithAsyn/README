To build any examples;

- in <motor>/configure/RELEASE: EPICS_BASE and MOTOR must be defined.

- in <motor>/Makefile: the following two lines must be uncommented;
  #DIRS := $(DIRS) $(filter-out $(DIRS), motorExApp)
  #DIRS := $(DIRS) $(filter-out $(DIRS), iocBoot)

To build this Newport MM4000/5/6 example;

- in <motor>/configure/RELEASE: IPAC and ASYN must all be defined.

- in <motor>/motorApp/Makefile: #DIRS += NewportSrc must be uncommented.

- in <motor>/motorExApp/Makefile: #DIRS += WithAsyn must be uncommented.

- in <motor>/motorExApp/WithAsyn/Makefile: uncomment both,
  #!WithAsyn_LIBS   += Newport
    and,
  #!WithAsynVx_LIBS += Newport

- in both <motor>/motorExApp/WithAsyn/WithAsynInclude.dbd, and in
  <motor>/motorExApp/WithAsyn/WithAsynVxInclude.dbd
  uncomment,  #include "devNewport.dbd"
          
Finally, cd <motor>; gnumake clean uninstall; gnumake

To run this Newport MM4000/5, "asyn" example on a Unix OS;
- Set the EPICS_HOST_ARCH environment variable correctly.
- Edit the st.cmd.unix file for either sun or linux.
- Start the ioc from this directory by executing the following command.

../../bin/${EPICS_HOST_ARCH}/WithAsyn st.cmd.unix
