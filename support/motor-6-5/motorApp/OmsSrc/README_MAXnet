Please note:

- The MAXnet IP-stack is very basic. You cannot ping the card and it doesn't know 
  anything about routing, which means you can only use it from hosts in the same
  subnet.
- MAXnet cards with firmware versions older than 1.33.4 shouldn't be used
  with the ethernet port. They abort communication, if they detect a tcp packet 
  with checksum 0xffff.
- MAXnet cards with firmware versions below 1.33 use "\n\r" as input EOS 
  on Ethernet ports. Version 1.33 and higher use "\n" on ethernet and serial ports.
  Comment the setInputEos call and set input EOS in st.cmd if using firmware
  versions below 1.33

add this to st.cmd if using the ethernet port:
  drvAsynIPPortConfigure("MAXNET","maxnet-ip-address:23",0,0,0)

add this to st.cmd if using the serial port:
  drvAsynSerialPortConfigure("MAXNET","/your/serial/device",0,0,0)
  asynSetOption("MAXNET",0,"baud","115200")
  asynSetOption("MAXNET",0,"bits","8")
  asynSetOption("MAXNET",0,"parity","none")
  asynSetOption("MAXNET",0,"crtscts","Y")

add this to Makefile
	# The following is required for the OMS MAXnet device driver.
	SRCS += drvMAXnetAsyn

add this to devOms.dbd
	# Oregon Micro Systems MAXnet Asyn driver support.
	driver(motorMAXnet)
	registrar(OmsMAXnetRegister)
	variable(motorMAXnetdebug)
