  <div style="text-align: left">
    <p>
      <b>64-bit compatability</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      64-bit compile problems with the PI E816 and Aerotech Ensemble device drivers were
      fixed. Mark Rivers made numerous changes to eliminate all 64-bit compiler warning
      messages.
    </p>
    <b>OMS MAXv</b>
    <p>
      Dirk Zimoch (PSI) fixed a bug in the OMS MAXv driver that caused the set_status()
      function to overwrite the home switch status in the response string
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>asyn motor</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Matthew Pearson (Diamond) fixed a bug on Newport XPS and MM4000 asyn motor port
        drives that was causing idle polling to interfere with setting positions and prevented
        auto save/restore from working. </li>
      <li>The asynMotor device support would leave a motor-in-motion indicator on if the
        motor record issued a LOAD_POS command before the 2nd pass of device support initialization.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Highland Technologies</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Support for the Highland Technologies V540 motor controller has been removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aerotech Ensemble</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Aerotech Ensemble device driver fixes for incorrect Jog speeds, support for a
        negative PosScaleFactor parameter and detecting maximum travel limit switch faults.
      </li>
      <li>This is the latest release to include the old Ensemble device driver architecture
        version. See below. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>RES field deleted</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The RES field was removed from the motor record database definition with this 
      release (R6-5). The RES field has been depreciated by the MRES field since R4-5.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <h4>
      New Features</h4>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: left">
    <p>
      <b>Aerotech Soloist and Ensemble motor controller support</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Two new drivers from Aerotech were add; an asyn motor version of the Ensemble 
      and the Soloist under the old driver architecture. Since the Ensemble network 
      connection requires period communication from the host to prevent the Ensemble 
      from closing the network socket, the Ensemble support based on the old device 
      driver architecture will be removed after R5-6. The asyn motor architecture 
      supports continuous, periodic updates; the old architecture does not.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ADEL and MDEL fields added</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Matthew Pearson (Diamond) added support for the ADEL and MDEL motor record 
      fields. Unlike most records, the ADEL/MDEL fields in the motor record apply to 
      the User Readback Value (RBV).  See the motorRecord.html document for details.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Synchronize field (SYNC)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      When the SYNC field is set to Yes(1) the record sets the Drive fields (VAL/DVAL/RVAL) 
      to their readback values (RBV/DRBV/RRBV) and sets SYNC field back to No(0).

    <h4>
      Modifications to Existing Features</h4>

    <p>
      <b>Stale SET position data from OMS VME58 controllers.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      A problem with certain OMS VME58 firmware versions (2.24-8S and all 2.35 versions)
      has arisen since modifications made under R6-3. When the user sets the motor record's
      position, the previous target and readback positions are read from the controller
      on the next update. This occurs with the previous release (R6-3) because the "stale
      data delay" was changed from 10ms to zero for the drvOms58 driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this release the driver searches all VME58 board ID's for either 2.24-8S or
      any 2.35 version. If any board is found with these versions, the "stale data delay"
      is set to a non-zero value for all VME58 boards in the system.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>"tdir=" error messages</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      A problem was reported by Emma Shepherd (Diamond) with the previous release if the
      "Use RDBL Link" field (URIP) was set to "Yes". The NTM logic was sending stop commands
      and issuing the "tdir=.." message to the console if the RDBL link was used. This
      error was the result of changes to the NTM logic in R6-3.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this release, the NTM logic is restored to using feedback rather than reference
      positions. In addition, an "NTM deadband factor" field (NTMF) is added to allow
      the user to set the NTM deadband as follows;
    </p>
    <p>
      NTM deadband = NTMF * (|BDST| + RDBD)
    </p>
    <p>
      NTMF must be >= 2. If properly configured, the NTM deadband prevents NTM logic from
      issuing a STOP command at the end of a DC motor move that overshoots its' target
      position.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Access Security Level changes</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Major changes have been made to the Access Security Level (ASL) attribute of the
      motor record fields. With previous releases, the following fields were set to ASL=0;
      FOF, VOF, SSET, SUSE, VBAS, VMAX, SBAS, SMAX, UREV and MRES. All other fields were
      set to ASL=1 by default.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this release, the policy is to set all the fields that the user requires to
      do the following to ASL = 0;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>move a motor; (VAL, DVAL, RVAL, TWF, TWR, TWV, RLV, JOGF, JOGR) </li>
      <li>stop a motor; (STOP, SPMG) </li>
      <li>enable/disable motor torque; (CNEN) </li>
      <li>set the position of a motor; (SSET, SUSE, SET) </li>
      <li>set the "user" offset of a motor; (FOF, VOF, FOFF,OFF) </li>
      <li>update the status of a motor; (STUP) </li>
      <li>adjust or turn off backlash; (BDST) </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      All other fields are set to ASL = 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      This means that out of the list of fields that were previously set to ASL=0; VBAS,
      VMAX, SBAS, SMAX, UREV and MRES are now set to ASL=1.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>OMS MAXv A24/A32 VMEbus addressing bug fix</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Previous releases had a problem with the OMS MAXv device driver when it was configured
      for more than one board, and, either A24 or A32 addressing was specified. The driver
      was not sizing the address space occupied by each MAXv correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>asyn motor archtecture updates</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Motor record GET_INFO commands were not supported by the asyn motor archtecture
        in previous releases. </li>
      <li>A motor record bug was fixed that caused unscheduled retries to occur with asyn
        motor. </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <h4>
      New Features</h4>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: left">
    <p>
      <b>Deferred moves for asyn motors</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The asyn motor framework now supports a flag to indicate that moves should be deferred.
      When at zero, moves proceed as normal. When set to one, moves should be deferred
      and remembered by the controller driver, but not executed immediately. When set
      back to zero, the controller driver should then start all the moves (or at least
      moves to the last requested demand positions) that have been deferred, as near to
      simultaneously as is possible for the particular model of controller. The flag is
      implemented per-controller, so all axes on a particular controller instance are
      affected, but axes on other controllers via the same driver are unaffected.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the responsibility of the motor controller driver to actually provide such
      functionality, or to give an error if the parameter is not recognised. Currently
      the Newport XPS controller driver and the Delta Tau PMAC driver (in the tpmac module
      available from Diamond) support this.
    </p>
    <p>
      To use the flag, connect to any asyn port/addr combination on the controller, using
      the parameter "DEFER". e.g. for a bo record, use DTYP=asynUInt32Digital, OUT=@asynMask(port,1,1)DEFER,
      ZNAM="Go", ONAM="Defer"
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>64-bit compatiablity</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Previous releases of the motor record distribution would not compile for 64-bit
      platforms. Numerous minor modifications were made for this release to attain 64-bit
      compatibility. Note that at the time of writing (03/14/08), this release was successfully
      compiled on a Linux Fedora Core 6 x86_64 host using gcc version 4.1.2, but there
      are bugs. Since EPICS base (R3.14.9) has not had all the bugs wrung out (Mantis
      ID's #309, #310), there are no immediate plans to debug 64-bit related problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>attocube systems AG ANC150</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Ron Sluiter added support for the attocube systems AG ANC150 Piezo Step Controller.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Aerotech's Ensemble</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Chad Weimer (Aerotech) added support for Aerotech's Ensemble family of digital servo
      controllers.

      <b>save/restore of motor positions</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark Rivers found and fixed a bug in the motor record that resulted in motor positions
      not being initialized from save/restore at boot-up if the retry deadband field (RDBD)
      was not included in a save set.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>motorUtil error message</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      A bug was introduced into the shell command "motorUtilInit()" affecting these versions
      of the motor distribution; R6-2, R6-2-1 and R6-2-2. This bug resulted in the erroneous
      error message; "motorUtilInit: Prefix %c: has more than 53 characters. Exiting"
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DC motor support</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Two changes were made to the motor record to better support DC motors.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>With this release, if retries are disabled (RTRY=0), then all moves are done in
        absolute mode. This allows a DC motor user to have the readback values calculated
        based on either the local encoder (UEIP) or the readback link (URIP), but still
        have all moves commanded in absolute mode. Previous releases the of the motor record
        would use relative moves if either the local or external readbacks were enabled,
        regardless of the state (enable/disable) of the retries. </li>
      <li>The New Target Monitoring (NTM field) logic is changed to use reference rather
        than feedback positions. This eliminates unwanted motor record STOP commands at
        the end of DC motor moves. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Examples renamed</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The examples iocNoMPF and iocWithMPF were renamed iocNoAsyn and iocWithAsyn, respectively.

    <p>
      The PM500 driver was not issuing the correct command when it queried for the number
      of axes at boot up. This resulted in a "PM500 system error" message on the 1st axis.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Overwritten PID Parameters</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      A bug was introduced with R6-0; the OMS device support was overwriting PID parameter
      fields during its' normalization calculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Motor Position Initialization</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a bug in the logic that determines the precedence between using the controller's
      or save/restore's motor position at boot-up. Negative controller positions were
      not handled correctly.

    <b>OMS VME58 Servo Limit Switch Problem</b></p>
  <p>
    The motor record would lock-up when a user tried to move off an activated limit
    switch with the OMS VME58 servo motor controller board (i.e., model -8S). Although
    this problem has been resolved there is a design problem with the OMS VME58 servo
    controller that prevents it, in most cases, from moving off an activated limit switch.
    Users are advised to avoid this situation
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Encoder Resolution (ERES) Polarity</b></p>
  <p>
    Previous releases of the motor record forced the sign of ERES to match the sign
    of MRES. With this release, ERES and MRES may have different signs. This allows
    the user to change the sign of ERES rather than reverse encoder wires when the motor
    and encoder direction are reversed. <b>Warning!</b> This does not work with controllers
    that are doing closed-loop control; e.g., DC motors. Reference (D/A) and feedback
    (encoder) signals must have the same polarity for DC motors or the motor will literally
    run away.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>PID parameter initialization</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    PID parameters (i.e., PCOF, ICOF and DCOF fields) were not initialized at boot-up.
    With this release, if the GAIN_SUPPORT bit in the MSTA is true, each nonzero, PID
    parameter will be initialized. For backwards compatibility, zero valued PID parameters
    will not be initialized.

    <b>IMS MDrive Device Driver</b>

    <p>
      <b>Status Update (STUP)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The STUP field (Status Update) has been modified due to bug fixes. The STUP field
      functions as follows;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Valid values for STUP are OFF(0), ON(1) and BUSY(2). </li>
      <li>A Channel Access (CA) client writes ON(1) to the STUP field which causes the motor
        record to set STUP to BUSY(2) and request a single controller status update. After
        the status is updated the record sets STUP to OFF(0). </li>
      <li>CA clients are restricted to writing ON(1) to STUP only when STUP is OFF(0). </li>
      <li>It is the responsibility of the user to restrict the frequency (and thus the incurred
        overhead) at which the CA client writes ON(1) to STUP. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      With the STUP field it is possible to have another EPICS record periodically write
      ON(1) to the motor record's STUP field. This would result in continuous, periodic
      status updates.

      <b>Newport MM3000 Communication</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Communication with the Newport MM3000 motor controller was getting out of synchronization
      whenever the MM3000 responded with an error message. This problem was resolved by
      having recv_mess() in drvMM3000.c detect an error message response, print the error
      message and then, recursively, call itself. This restored communication transmit/receive
      synchronization.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>OMS VX2-006 Spurious Interrupts</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Spurious interrupts were occurring with OMS VX2-006 ver 1.04 controller boards.
      For the sake of throughput, the OMS VME8/44 device driver enables the done (DON_E)
      and input buffer full (IBF_E) interrupts, but disables the transmit buffer empty
      (TBE_E).
    </p>
    <p>
      The OMS boards are RORA VME type interrupters. The "release" register is the status
      register. It contains information on the status of the transmit/receive buffer interrupts
      and the done interrupt. Since the device driver was not using the transmit buffer
      empty interrupt, it was polling the status register when sending a command to the
      controller. With the VX2, if the IRQ became active during a status register read
      cycle, the IRQ was negated at the end of the cycle and the CPU board generated a
      spurious interrupt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The VME8/44 models somehow prevented the spurious interrupts from occurring by latching
      the IRQ, if and when, the IRQ became active during a status register read.
    </p>
    <p>
      This problem has been fixed by using all of the OMS board interrupts (i.e., enable
      transmit buffer empty). The OMS VME8/44/VX2/VS4 design is limited with regard to
      interrupts by an all or none choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Backlash Correction Bug Fix</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      With release R4-7, there was a slight (undocumented) modification made to the way
      that backlash correction functioned. If a move is in the preferred direction and
      the backlash speed and acceleration are the same as the slew speed and acceleration,
      then the backlash move is skipped and the motor moves directly to the target position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, there was a bug in the logic that appeared only when MRES&lt; 0.
      When MRES &lt; 0, and the backlash speed and acceleration were the same as the slew
      speed and acceleration, the motor record did the opposite of the requirements; i.e.,
      it did backlash correction when the move was in the preferred direction and did
      not do backlash correction when the move was not in the preferred direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Newport ESP300 Device Driver Crash</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Newport ESP300 would randomly crash at boot-up because an internal parameter
      ("drive_resolution") was not always, under all configurations, initialized. With
      this release, the "drive_resolution" is set based on the response to the ESP300
      "SU?" command.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, the user is required to set MRES to the resolution of the controller
      as explained in the distribution document <i>motor</i>/motorApp/NewportSrc/README.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Update Rate Bug Fix</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two timing related bugs with the previous release (R5.1). First, the
      update rate was not working properly. The end result was that the motor task was
      polling controllers as fast as possible. Second, there was an error in the motor_task
      function process_messages() that enforces a time delay between UNDEFINED or IMMEDIATE
      type commands (e.g., LOAD_POS, SET_ENC_RATIO, etc.) and an INFO type command. One
      result of this error was that on OMS VME58 controllersan INFO update after a LOAD_POS
      command would, intermittently, yield the previous position.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Backlash Correction after Jogging Bug Fix</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Backlash correction after jogging was not working for controllers that do not support
      multiple position commands on the same command line (e.g., Newport ESP300). This
      has been corrected with this release with one caveat; in contrast to the feature
      described in <i>Backlash Correction Bug Fix</i> above, backlash correction is always
      done after jogging, regardless of the jog acceleration and speed parameters
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>DLY field</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Although there is no explicit statement in the motor record documentation, most
      user's would expect the "Readback settle time" field (DLY) to update the readback
      after the delay timeout. It did not do this. With this release, the readback is
      updated one time after the timeout.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since a functioning DLY field performs the same function as the drvReadbackDelay
      variables, with the added advantage that the delay can be motor specific, the drvReadbackDelay
      variables have been deleted (except for the MM4000).

    motor synchronizes it's target position (i.e., VAL/DVAL/RVAL) with it's readback
    position (RBV/DRBV/RRBV). &nbsp;Given an application where there are two or more
    soft motors driving the system (e.g., slit), when one soft motor is moved, the other
    soft motor <i>sees</i> it's readback changing and synchronizes it's target position
    with it's readback position at the end of the move, thereby losing it's target position.<br />
  </div>
  <p>
  </p>
  <div style="text-align: left">
    With this release, the LOCK field has been added to allow the user to enable/disable
    synchronization due to the readback changing.

    <h4>
      Backlash Correction Bug Fixes</h4>
    The following scenario would put the motor record into an invalid state. &nbsp;A
    new target position (i.e., VAL/DVAL/RVAL) is written to the motor record under the
    following conditions;<br />
    <ol>
      <li>motion is in progress (i.e., DMOV is false). </li>
      <li>the new target position is different from the actual position by less than the
        retry deadband (|DIFF| &lt; RDBD). </li>
      <li>backlash correction is enabled (i.e., BDST is non-zero) and the new move is <b>
        not</b> in the "preferred direction" (preferred direction is the direction in which
        the motor moves during the backlash-takeout part of a motor move). </li>
    </ol>
    A bug was introduced in R4.5 when backlash correction was changed.&nbsp; The error
    occurred when a new target position was issued while the motor was moving.&nbsp;
    The motor would move to the new target position at the backlash velocity rather
    than the slew velocity.<br />
    <br />
    Thanks to Kevin M. Peterson, James B. Stevens and John Maclean for their help in
    finding and fixing these bugs.

      <b>Motor Record Version 4.5 Release Notice</b></h1>
  </div>
  <p>
    <b>!WARNING!</b><br />
    motorRecord.dbd has been modified.&nbsp; This requires you to 'rebuild' any and
    all user trees (i.e., &lt;ioctop&gt;) that load the motor record (see README item
    #2 for details).
  </p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <h4>
      Modifications to Existing Features</h4>
  </div>
  <p>
    <b>Communication Retries</b></p>
  <p>
    Once a communication error is detected, one retry is attempted (Further retries
    are made, if the position RETRY field is non-zero).&nbsp; If the retry fails, then
    a communication error is reported.&nbsp; No further attempt is made to communicate
    with the controller until subsequent user input (e.g., a new target position is
    entered).&nbsp; This change affects all device drivers using GPIB or RS232 serial
    communication mechanisms (i.e., non-VME Bus boards).
  </p>
  <h4>
    Requirements Clarification</h4>
  <p>
    The requirements on how the motor record processes a new target position while the
    motor is in motion have never been specified.&nbsp; The requirements are as follows:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Case #1: &nbsp;The motor record is given a new position, which is in the opposite
      direction from the current motor motion.&nbsp; The motor is immediately stopped
      and given a motion command to the new position.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Case #2: &nbsp;The motor record is given a new position, which is in the same direction
      as the current motor motion, but the new position is closer to the motor's current
      position than the original target position.&nbsp; The motor is stopped after it
      has gone past the new position; then a command is given to return to the new position.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Case #3: &nbsp;The motor record is given a new position, which is in the same direction
      as the current motor motion, but the new position is further from the motor's current
      position than the original position. &nbsp;After the motor reaches the original
      target position and stops, a command is given to the new target position (Previous
      motor record versions ignored the new target position.)
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <h4>
    Bug Fix for Driver Power Monitoring error</h4>
  <p>
    The <i>Driver Power Monitoring</i> feature (available only with OMS VME58 controllers)
    was erroneously and randomly being enabled.&nbsp; This resulted in the error message
    <i>Drive power failure at VME58 card# motor# </i>appearing at the VxWorks console.</p>
  <p>
    <b>Soft Channel device support modifications</b>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Prevent record processing before "interruptAccept" is true.&nbsp; This helps prevent
      alarms. </li>
    <li>If the readback is changing, but motion was not initiated by this record, then
      reset the motor record's target to actual position (i.e., VAL/DVAL/RVAL = RBV/DRBV/RRBV)
      after the move. </li>
    <li>Lowered the priority of the "soft_motor task below the "dbCaLink"task.&nbsp; This
      fixes the "DMOV processing before the last DRBV update" problem.<br />
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <b>Bug Fix for Array Holes in VMEbus based controllers</b></p>
  <p>
    For VMEbus based motor controllers only (i.e., OMS), a <i>hole</i> in an array of
    VME based motor controller boards caused the system to crash with a memory <i>access
      error</i> on the address of the missing controller.&nbsp; For example, if oms58Setup(3,
    8, 0x4000, 190, 5, 10) was issued without a board at 0xFFFF5000, a bus error would
    occur if the user attempted to move a motor on the missing board.
  </p>
  <p>
    This release allows <i>holes </i>in an array of VMEbus based motor controllers.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>RES Field</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    With previous releases of the motor record, the RES field was set to either ERES
    or MRES, based on whether or not the following statement was true; MSTA indicates
    an encoder is present, AND, UEIP is set to YES.&nbsp; This state (i.e., MSTA indicates
    an encoder is present, AND, UEIP is set to YES) resulted in the record converting
    all position and velocity related values from EGU's to raw encoder counts before
    sending them to the motor controller.&nbsp; This is the manner in which the OMS
    controllers work (see OMS User's Manual, ER# command).
  </p>
  <p>
    With this release, all raw positions, velocity and acceleration are in terms of
    motor steps. &nbsp;The RES field is preserved for backward compatibility only. &nbsp;With
    this release, the RES field is always equal to MRES.
    <br />
  </p>
  <h4>
    Backlash Correction</h4>
  <p>
    Previous motor record releases put both the "slew" and backlash correction moves
    on the same motor controller command line.&nbsp; Some controllers (i.e., OMS) handled
    this correctly by processing the slew move followed by the backlash correction move.&nbsp;
    Other controllers (i.e, Newport) did not handle this correctly and processed the
    commands immediately, resulting in the controller moving to the target position
    without backlash correction, but at the backlash correction velocity.</p>
  <p>
    With this release, backlash correction commands are not issued to the controller
    until after the slew move is completed.</p>
  <h4>
    Separa<b>te +/- Limit Switch status bits</b></h4>
  <p>
    The MSTA field has been modified by providing separate +/- limit switch status bits.
    &nbsp;The MSTA bits are defined as follows:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <ol>
      <li>DIRECTION: (0:Negative, 1:Positive) </li>
      <li>DONE: motion is complete. </li>
      <li>PLUS_LS: plus limit switch has been hit. </li>
      <li>HOMELS: state of the home limit switch. </li>
      <li>Unused </li>
      <li>POSITION: closed-loop position control is enabled. </li>
      <li>Unused </li>
      <li>HOME: if at home position. </li>
      <li>PRESENT: encoder is present. </li>
      <li>PROBLEM: driver stopped polling. </li>
      <li>MOVING: non-zero velocity present. </li>
      <li>GAIN_SUPPORT: motor supports closed-loop position control. </li>
      <li>COMM_ERR: Controller communication error. </li>
      <li>MINUS_LS: minus limit switch has been hit.<br />
      </li>

    <b>RVAL ignored error</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    A problem was discovered with entering target positions through RVAL.&nbsp; If the
    difference between the current and the next target position (i.e., RDIF, DIFF) was
    less than the retry deadband (RDBD), and the next target position was in the "preferred
    direction", then the new RVAL was ignored.&nbsp; This error occured on releases

  <p>
    <b>STOP field hangs record</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    An error was introduced into the motor record with the release of V4.2 (see README
    file item #14 under V4.2 ).&nbsp; This error occurred if the STOP field was activated
    when the motor was not moving (i.e., MIP = 0).&nbsp; The motor record would become
    "stuck", and not respond to a move request (due to the internal state machine associated
    with IP being set to the "stop" state), until the condition was cleared by either
    a SPMG-stop or some other user action that forced the MIP field to zero.
  </p>

    <b>Precedence between field pairs</b></p>
  <p>
    At boot-up, if one field of a field pair (i.e., VMAX/SMAX, VBAS/SBAS, VELO/S, BVEL/SBAK)
    is zero and the other field is nonzero, the nonzero field takes precedence.&nbsp;
    If both fields of a given field pair are nonzero, the RPS member of the field pair
    (i.e., SMAX, SBAS, S, SBAK) takes precedence.&nbsp; This requirement was lost with
    the release of V4.0.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Moving Off a Limit Switch with a Oms58 device</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    An error occurs with the OMS VME58 when the user runs the motor into a limit switch
    and then attempts to move away from the limit switch.&nbsp; If either an absolute
    or incremental move is utilized to move away from the limit switch, the OMS VME58
    ignores the 1st move attempt.&nbsp; Subsequent moves work.&nbsp; In addition, the
    user can jog off a limit switch.&nbsp; This error was hidden in most applications
    if RTRY was nonzero.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Separate motion commands for target and backlash moves</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    The record level support assumed that the motor controller would accept two motion
    commands on the same command line.&nbsp; This occurs when backlash compensation
    is enabled.&nbsp; Since the IM483[PL/SM] controller does not have this capability,
    support for a command line "record separator" character was added.&nbsp; The record
    separator is defined as an ASCII (IS2) character = /x1E.&nbsp; Currently, only one
    record separator is allowed in a command line.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Errors introduced in V4.0</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, several errors were introduced into the motor record with V4.0.&nbsp;
    The following have been fixed:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>If the "ncards" argument of the omsSetup() function in st.cmd file was not accurate
      (i.e., did not match the actual number of OMS VME8/44 boards in the VME crate);
      the "dbior" command could result in erroneous information or a bus error. </li>
    <li>Jog request would not work after the state of the UEIP field was changd. </li>
    <li>Backlash correction was not occurring after a JOG. </li>
    <li>The motor record would 'hang' in the moving state on the rare occasion when a
      target position (i.e., VAL or DVAL) fell almost exactly half way between two integer
      RVAL values, and the retry feature was enabled (i.e., RTRY is nonzero) </li>

    Several errors in the OMS VME58 driver were found.&nbsp; All the errors caused the
    same problem.&nbsp; Namely, erroneous retries occurred intermittently when multiple
    axes were commanded to move on the same controller.&nbsp; This error occurred because
    old position data was being passed back from the driver after Done was detected.&nbsp;
    The erroneous intermittent retries occurred more often when the Oms setup parameters
    called for a high frequency (e.g., 60 Hz) "polling" rate and OMS board interrupts
    were enabled.</p>
  <h4>
    <b>OMS Stop problem</b></h4>

    A problem with issuing a stop command (via either the STOP or SPMG field) was found
    with <b>all</b> OMS boards and <b>all </b>versions of the OMS device drivers.&nbsp;

  <h4>
    <b>GAIN Field Removed</b></h4>
  <p>
    Since the GAIN field is redundant (i.e., PID parameters can be set individually)
    it has been removed.</p>
  <h4>
    <b>HOM[F/R] Bug Fix</b></h4>
  <p>
    Previous releases of the motor record had a potential problem associated with the
    homing function.&nbsp; The motorx_all.adl V1.9 MEDM display sets the HOM[F/R] fields
    on and off, corresponding to the user pressing and releasing the respective home
    button.&nbsp; Depending on the <i>pollRate</i> defined in the st.cmd <i>Setup</i>
    command and the speed at which the user toggled the HOM[F/R] buttons; the record
    level software would turn off the DMOV field when the HOM[F/R] button was turned
    off and a motor status update had not yet been received.&nbsp; As a result, when
    the motor completed it's homing function the command positions (i.e., VAL, DVAL,
    RVAL) were not updated.</p>
  <p>
    All previous motor record releases contained the DMOV problem; the commanded position
    update problem was limited to the previous release (V3.5).&nbsp; With this release,
    a dbPutField to either HOMF or HOMR is valid on a FALSE to TRUE transition (i.e.,
    0 to 1), but a TRUE to FALSE transition (i.e., 1 to 0) will result in an error.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <i>motorx_all.adl_V2.2</i> (which is included with this distribution) sets the HOM[F/R]
    fields on when the user presses the homing button, but is does <b>not</b> set it
    off when the button is released.&nbsp; The motor record clears the HOM[F/R] field
    when the homing operation is done (i.e., completed or terminated).
    <br />
    &nbsp;
  </p>
  <h4>
    Initial Position</h4>
  <p>
    If both the auto restore and controller target position values are non-zero at boot-up,
    then DVAL will be initialized from the controller's value.&nbsp; In other words,
    the controller's target position takes precedence over the autorestore value when
    both systems have non-zero DVAL values.&nbsp; As before, it is assumed that a zero
    target position from autorestore or the controller at boot-up are default values,
    and hence, they are ignored in favor of a non-zero value.</p>
  <p>
    Previous releases of the motor record allowed the auto restore to take precedence
    over the controller when initializing the target position (i.e., DVAL).
    <br />
    &nbsp;
  </p>
  <h4>
    Access Security Level</h4>

  </blockquote>
  <h4>
    MM4000/5 Device Driver</h4>
  <p>
    Although the previous motor record release (V3.5) had device driver support for
    the MM4000, it is <b>not</b> recommended for use with either the MM4000 or the MM4005
    controllers.&nbsp; The following changes were made to the previous release to create,
    what is now, the MM4000/5 device driver support:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The MM4000 device driver software supports both the MM4000 and MM4005 controllers.&nbsp;
      Driver level software detects and saves which controller it is communicating with
      at boot-up.&nbsp; Currently, there are two functional differences&nbsp; between
      the two models.
      <ol>
        <li>The MM4005's position cannot be set by a host.&nbsp; This mean that, for the MM4005
          only, setting the motor record RVAL or DVAL fields has no effect. </li>
        <li>Since the MM4005's position cannot be set by EPICS, the initial position of its'
          motors (see <i>Initial Position </i>above) will always be initialized from the controller's
          value. </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The MM4005 supports up to eight axes.&nbsp; User access to the controller's front
      panel is required to scroll the front panel display through all eight axes.&nbsp;
      Since <i>remote mode</i> locks out the user from using the controller's front panel,
      the motor record no longer puts the MM4000/5 in <i>remote mode</i> .&nbsp; EPICS
      is unable to communicate with the MM4000/5 controller if it is in <i>local</i> <i>
        mode</i> and the front panel is not at the top menu.&nbsp;&nbsp; A <i>Controller communication
          error</i> bit was allocated in the MSTA field to help aid user's in diagnosing
      a controller communication error.&nbsp; Currently, only the MM4000/5 device driver
      sets this error indicator.&nbsp; When the communication error bit is set True in
      the MSTA, the motor record SEVR field is set to INVALID_ALARM and the STAT field
      is set to COMM_ALARM.&nbsp; User's who want their MM4000/5 in remote mode at boot-up
      can add the remote mode command ("MR") to&nbsp; their INIT field. </li>
  </ol>
  <h4>
    Bug Fix for OMS VME58 running on PowerPC</h4>
  <p>
    Through an odd set of circumstances the Oms58 driver was not performing status updates
    on PowerPC (PPC) platforms.&nbsp; All users of the OMS VME58 controller on a PPC
    platform must upgrade to Motor Record version 4.0 for full functionality.</p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <h4>
      New Features</h4>
  </div>
  <p>
    <b>Newport MM3000 Device Support</b></p>
  <p>
    Device driver support for the MM3000 exist for this release of the motor record.&nbsp;
    Note the following differences between the MM4000 and MM3000 device drivers:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The MM3000 does not support a generic <i>Load Position </i>commands.&nbsp; In
      other words, the user can only define the current controller position as being the
      zero position.&nbsp; This limitation is reflected in the motor record device support.&nbsp;
      When the SET field is true, the only valid entry to either the DVAL or RVAL fields
      is zero. </li>
    <li>The only position units the MM3000 will communicate with the host in, are either
      encoder ticks or stepper motor steps. </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>
    Uninitialized Oms/Oms58 Driver Error Check</h4>
  <p>
    With previous release, if the Oms or Oms58 driver was some how omitted from the
    database, a "... card does not exist" error message would result.&nbsp; With this
    release, an explicit error check and corresponding error message (i.e., "Oms[58]
    driver uninitialized. ") is issued at record initialization if a required driver
    is not initialized. (Because of the particulars of MM[3000/4000] initialization,
    this is not an issue with Newport controllers.)</p>
  <h4>
    Maximum Velocity Fields (VMAX/SMAX)</h4>
  <p>
    Maximum velocity fields have been added; VMAX in EGU/s units and SMAX in RPS units.</p>
  <p>
    In order to support BURT, range checking is done in such a way that any minimum
    (i.e., VBAS/SBAS) or maximum (i.e., VMAX/SMAX) value entered is valid.&nbsp; For
    example, if the minimum is entered and it exceeds the maximum, then the maximum
    is set to the new minimum value.&nbsp; Slew (VELO/S) and backup velocity (BVEL/SBAK)
    fields are forced by the motor record to be within the range set by VMAX/SMAX and
    VBAS/SBAS, inclusively.&nbsp; For example, if VELO is entered and it is less than
    the minimum, then VELO is set to VBAS.
  </p>
  <p>
    To facilitate software upgrades, a zero VMAX disables maximum velocity error checking.&nbsp;
    Those who use both BURT and VMAX (i.e., nonzero VMAX) should insure that VMAX and
    VBAS are placed before VELO and BVEL in their BURT <i>request files.&nbsp; </i>VMAX/SMAX
    have Access Security Level zero.
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>motorx_setup_1.7.adl</i> (which is included with this distribution) includes
    support for the maximum velocity fields.

      Motor Record Version 3.5 Release Notice</h1>
  </div>
  <p>
    Release 3.5 of the motor record is only compatible with EPICS baseR3.13.1.1 and
    above.&nbsp; This document describes changes made to the motor record and its' associated
    device driver support between versions 3.4 and 3.5.&nbsp; Those changes are as follows:</p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <h4>
      Modifications to Existing Features</h4>
  </div>
  <h4>
    Command Primitives</h4>
  <p>
    <b>This feature is available only with OMS VME8/44/58 or Newport MM4000 device support
      (i.e., devOms, devOms58, devMM4000)</b>. Three motor record fields are available
    to the user to send ASCII command primitives to the servo control board at fixed,
    predefined, times.&nbsp; Each of the following fields is defined as a character
    string:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      1. INIT - Sent at record initialization.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      2. PREM - Sent before every command string that causes motion.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      3. POST - Sent after a complete motion is finished or when an overtravel limit switch
      is detected.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    No error checking is done by the motor record or the device driver to insure that
    the command strings are valid.&nbsp; Command primitives that result in a response
    from the motion control board are valid, but the response is not processed.</p>
  <h4>
    Servo related Fields</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The GAIN field "prompt" has been changed from "Response Gain" to "Combined Gain".&nbsp;
      In addition, valid values for the GAIN field have been changed to [0.0, for MM4000
      - 0.00005, for OMS] &lt;= GAIN &lt;= 1.&nbsp; For more on PID, see "PID Gain Parameters"
      below. </li>
    <li>The <i>status enable </i>field (i.e., STEN) has been eliminated; the <i>control
      enable </i>field (i.e., CNEN) is used to both control the torque enable and show
      its' status. </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>
    Unused Fields Removed</h4>
  <p>
    The following unused motor record fields were deleted: MODE, TRAK, MDEL, ADEL, CVEL,
    POSM, ALST, MLST</p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <h4>
      New Features</h4>
  </div>
  <h4>
    Device Directives</h4>
  <p>
    Device directive definition and processing:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Valid only in the INIT field. </li>
    <li>Must be identified by the following;
      <ul>
        <li>First character of INIT string must be a '@'. </li>
        <li>One or more characters followed by a terminating '@'; i.e., device directives
          must have nonzero length. </li>
        <li>A valid device directive; currently, only "DPM_ON". </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>INIT strings are stripped of valid device directives (including @'s) and tested
      for nonzero length before being sent to the controller.&nbsp; For example, given
      the INIT string, "@DPM_ON@HE", the device directive @DPM_ON@ is stripped out before
      HE is sent to the controller. </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>
    Driver Power Monitoring</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>This feature is only available with the OMS VME58 device support. </li>
    <li>The 8 User I/O signals are assigned to the 8 possible VME58 axes as follows: </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    User I/O #0 &lt;&gt; X axis
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " 1 &lt;&gt; Y&nbsp; "
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    .....................
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " 7 &lt;&gt; S&nbsp; "</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Drive-power monitoring defaults to disabled at boot-up.&nbsp; Request enabling
      drive-power monitoring by entering the device directive "@DPM_ON@" command into
      the motor record initialization field (i.e., INIT).&nbsp; The INIT field is processed
      at record initialization (i.e., bootup), hence if there are no errors, drive-power
      monitoring will be enabled after the next bootup. </li>
    <li>Whenever a request is made to enable drive-power status monitoring, an error check
      is made (using the VME58 "RB" command) to verify that the User I/O has been configured
      as an input.&nbsp; The following message will appear in the error log if a configuration
      error is detected; "Invalid VME58 configuration; RB = 0x####", where "####" is the
      VME58's response to the RB command. </li>
    <li>When drive-power status monitoring is enabled and a power failure is detected,
      the device driver will respond by activating the the RA_OVERTRAVEL bit in the MSTA.&nbsp;
      This results in either HLS or LLS being activated depending on the DIR field. In
      addition, the following message will appear in the error log; "Drive power failure
      at VME58 card#?? motor#??". </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>
    Soft Channel Device Support</h4>
  <p>
    The immediate goals for soft channel motor record device support were twofold.&nbsp;
    First, to solve the problem of nonlinear position conversion in the data base, rather
    than in the record.&nbsp; Second, to provide a more flexible motor record interface
    for Table Records and SPEC.</p>
  <p>
    New fields have been added to the motor record to support the Soft Channel device
    driver.&nbsp;&nbsp; The new fields are all database links associated with existing
    motor record fields.&nbsp; The new links and their associated fields are listed
    in the table below:

  <h4>
    Newport MM4000 Device Support</h4>
  <p>
    This is <a href="http://cars1.uchicago.edu/software/dev_mm4000.html">Mark Rivers MM4000</a>
    device support ported to the latest motor record release.&nbsp; The following are
    the functional differences between Mark's version 1.01 and<br />
    this release:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <ol>
      <li>When either user or dial travel limit values are entered, a validity check is
        made using the travel limit values from the MM4000 control.&nbsp; User and dial
        travel limit values are valid if they are within the travel limits set on the front
        panel of the MM4000 controller.&nbsp; Attempting to enter a travel limit outside
        the MM4000 controller's range results in the travel limit being reset to the MM4000's
        value. </li>
      <li>Servo support has been extended to the MM4000 controller. </li>
    </ol>
  </blockquote>
  <h4>
    PID Gain Parameters</h4>
  <p>
    With this release there are two ways to set the motor controllers' PID parameters;
    either through the <i>Combined Gain </i>field (i.e., GAIN) or through the individual
    PID gain parameter fields (i.e., PCOF, ICOF, DCOF).&nbsp; Let the motor controller
    PID parameters be represented by CKP, CKI and CKD; then the relationship between
    these two methods is as follows:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      For the MM4000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For all OMS controllers
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>CKP&nbsp; = GAIN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      CKP =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1999.9 * GAIN </li>
    <li>CKI&nbsp;&nbsp; = 2 * GAIN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      CKI =&nbsp; 2 * 1999.9 * GAIN </li>
    <li>CKD = 3 * GAIN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      CKD = 3 * 1999.9 * GAIN </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Note that setting any of the individual PID record fields is <b>not</b>reflected
    in the value of the GAIN field.</p>
  <h4>
    Highland V544 Device Support</h4>
  <p>
    Device support for the Highland V544 is available with this release.&nbsp; This
    version (i.e., version 1.3) is functionally the same as the earlier release (i.e.,
    version 1.2).&nbsp; No new features have been added.
  </p>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <h1>
      Motor Record Version 3.4 Release Notice</h1>
  </div>
  <p>
    This document describes changes made to the motor record and its' associated device
    driver support between versions 3.3 and 3.4.&nbsp; Those changes are as follows:</p>
  <h3>
    Device driver design error fix
  </h3>
  <p>
    A design error was discovered in the OMS device drivers (drvOms and drvOms58).&nbsp;
    The EPICS device driver support task (i.e., tmotor) would query the OMS motion controller
    for status information immediately after a motion command.&nbsp; Since the state
    of the controller board was in the midst of changing, this sometimes resulted in
    inconsistent or conflicting status information being returned to the motor record.&nbsp;
    This problem was remedied by enforcing a minimum time delay (16.67 ms) between a
    motion command and a status query.</p>
  <p>
    It is difficult to enumerate the symptoms associated with this problem.&nbsp; Sometimes
    they exhibited themselves intermittently, other times bad data stayed in the record.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Several symptoms are as follows:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>Erroneous motor stops being issued by the device support when changing motor direction.
      </li>
      <li>Backlash occurring when the motor is moving in the same direction as the sign
        of BDST. </li>
      <li>DVAL and RBV becoming out-of-synch.&nbsp; RBV would always be an old value from
        the previous move. </li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>
    PID Parameter Support for VME58
  </h3>
  <p>
    The motor record classifies a motor as a servo if it has two features; an adjustable
    closed loop position response gain and the ability to enable/disable closed loop
    position control (i.e., motor torque).&nbsp; A motor lacking either of the above
    two features is classified as a stepper and is supported by the standard motor record
    features.&nbsp; The following three motor record fields support servo motors:</p>
  <p>
    &nbsp; 1. GAIN - Closed loop position response gain of the motor.
    <br />
    &nbsp; 2. CNEN - Enable/disable closed loop position control request.
    <br />
    &nbsp; 3. STEN - Closed loop position control status (i.e.,
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; enabled/disabled).
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, servo support is only available with OMS's VME58 device support (i.e.,
    VME58-[4S/8S/2S2/2S6/4S4/6S2] model boards).&nbsp; At driver initialization, the
    driver automatically detects whether or not the underlying device supports the use
    of the GAIN field and thereby classifies the motor as a stepper or a servo.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Bit#11 of the MSTA field is set on/off based on the results of this test.&nbsp;
    If the device supports the GAIN field, then bit#11 of the MSTA is set on and all
    of the above servo fields are enabled.&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise, they are disabled
    and bit#11 of the MSTA is set off.&nbsp; When the servo fields are disabled, they
    can still be read or written to without an error response.
  </p>
  <p>
    The VME58 device support allows the closed loop position gain of the motor to be
    set directly through the GAIN field.&nbsp; For the VME58, setting the GAIN field
    value results in the Combined Coefficient command (i.e., KK#) being executed with
    the GAIN field value as the argument to the command.&nbsp; This command, in turn,
    sets the PID loop parameter values (with the OMS VME58, gain changes do not take
    effect until the command velocity is zero).
  </p>
  <p>
    The user can request that the closed loop position control be enabled or disabled
    by setting the CNEN field nonzero or zero, respectively.
    <br />
    Likewise, the user can monitor the state of closed loop position control (i.e.,
    enabled/disabled) by reading the STEN field.&nbsp; See the OMS "VME58 Family User's
    Manual" for further details.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Command primitives feature
  </h3>
  <p>
    Three motor record fields are available to the user that can be used to send ASCII
    command primitives to the servo control board at fixed, predefined, times.&nbsp;
    Each field is defined as a character string.</p>
  <p>
    &nbsp; 1. INIT - Sent at record initialization.
    <br />
    &nbsp; 2. PREM - Sent before every command string that causes motion.
    <br />
    &nbsp; 3. POST - Sent after a complete motion is finished.
  </p>
  <p>
    No error checking is done by the motor record or the device driver to insure that
    the command strings are valid.&nbsp; Command primitives that result in a response
    from the motion control board are valid, but the response is not processed.
