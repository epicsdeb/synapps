New Focus 8750 Picomotor controller

- RS232: 2-3 swap (Horizontal jumpers on xm-octal panel). 
	 Baud = 19200
	 Dbits = 8
	 Sbits = 1
	 Parity = N


- In your st.cmd file:
  # New Focus Picomotor controller (Model 8750)
  dbLoadTemplate("picoMotor.substitutions", top)

- In st_mpfserver.cmd:
  tyGSMPFInit("serial1",  0, 0, 19200,'N',1,8,'N',"") /* NF Picomotor */

- In auto_positions.req:
  xxx:S1:A1:pM0_pos.VAL
  xxx:S1:A1:pM0_prev.VAL
  ...for each motor...

- In medm screen that calls the top level picomotor screen (related
  display button):
      display[2] {
              label="9 PicoMotors"
              name="picoMotor_9.adl"
              args="P=xxx:,S=S1"
      }


- Min Velocity must be less than Velocity.

- E-Stop will cause the motor to lose position.

- ETA is an *estimate* of the time to complete the move.  This gives the
  user an (inexact) idea of how long the motor will be running.

- Joystick must be off and Driver must be on for EPICS operation.

- IF the controller is reset (power cycled) and the crate is not:
  - "joystick off", "driver on", must be re-asserted. 
  - dynamics parms must be re-asserted, _if_ they have not been
    hardware-saved.

- IF the crate is reset and the controller is not:
  - all parameters should be restored properly by autosave.
