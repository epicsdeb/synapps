1/15/03 kag Eurotherm2k.db:

This is support for the Eurotherm 2048 Temperature controller.
The database runs a continuous loop that reads process temperature,
setpoint, ramp rate and power output.  This loop is temporarily
suspended if writes are made to these parameters.  This is also
the case if the PID values are written to.  PID values are only
intended to be *read* by processing the "ReadPID" seq record.  This
seq record will also suspend the main read loop.

The serial port is 3-wire, connected:

2408  db9
----  ---
 HD    5
 HE    3
 HF    2

This can then be connected straight through to the XM-Octal db9.

NOTE: This software assumes that the 2408 is configured for:
deg = C
Ramp rate = min
