Serial connection: Used straight-through RJ11 (6-cond).  
IP (XM-OCTAL) jumpers default

RJ-11 recepticle (taper at bottom)
| | | | | |
1 2 3 4 5 6

1,2 = RxD (to db9 pin 3)
3,4 = GND (to db9 pin 5)
5,6 = TxD (to db9 pin 2)

1200 or 300 Baud only. 7 data bits. 1 stop bit. Odd parity.

This device wants cr/lf.  This is the default setting .  Since I 
used serial records, could only set one send/recieve terminator.  
Therefore I set ODEL to be 10 decimal which is lf, and IDEL to 13 
decimal which is cr.
