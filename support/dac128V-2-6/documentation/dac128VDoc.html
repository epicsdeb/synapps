    This file describes support for the Systran DAC128V, an 8 channel, 12-bit D/A converter
    in the Industry Pack form factor. This support is a simple C++ driver derived from
    <a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/modules/soft/asyn/R4-13/asynPortDriver.html">
      asynPortDriver</a>, which is part of <a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/modules/soft/asyn/">
        asyn</a>. It uses the standard asyn device support for ao records. It supports
    both the asynInt32 and asynFloat64 interfaces. The asynInt32 interface is used for
    ao records. The asynFloat64 is provided for use with the fast feedback in the <a
      href="http://cars9.uchicago.edu/software/epics/epidRecord.html">EPID record</a>,
    which is part of the <a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/bcda/synApps/std/std.html">std</a>
    module in <a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/bcda/synApps/">synApps</a>. It uses the
    <a href="https://svn.aps.anl.gov/trac/epics/ipac">ipac module</a> for Industry Pack
    communication.</p>
  <p>
    Several databases are provided in the Db directory, as well as medm screens in the
    op/adl directory.</p>

    Hardware Configuration</h2>
  <p>
    The minimum and maximum voltage of the DAC128V IP module are set by jumpers. The
    minimum voltage choices are -10V, -5V or 0V, and the maximum voltage choices are
    0V, +5V and +10V.</p>
  <p>
    NOTE: The factory configuration is minimum and maximum both set to 0V, so the DAC
    won't put out any voltage! You MUST change the jumpers before installing the module.</p>
  <p>
    CAUTION: The modules always initializes (after VME reset or power-on) to the midpoint
    of the minimum and maximum voltages that are jumper selected. Thus, if the range
    is -10V to +10V then it will come up at 0V, while if the range is 0 to +5V it will
    come up at 2.5V. If you are connecting the device to something that should not have
    voltage applied at reset (such as a heater, or DC motor amplifier, etc.) then always
    select either -10V to +10V or -5V to +5V range, so that it will power up at 0V.</p>
  <p>
    NOTE: The module can supply up to 20mA over its full output voltage if it is connected
    to an external 15V power supply. If you use the internal VME 12V supply, which is
    the factory default configuration, then the following are true:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The module accurately outputs -10V to +10V into a high impedance.</li>
    <li>The module can supply 20mA up to about +9V with good output voltage accuracy.
      Above +9V the output is not accurate when supplying more than 1mA or so. I have
      found that when programming 10V output into a 1 kOhm load (10 mA output) the actual
      voltage is 9.3-9.6V.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Startup Script</h2>
  <p>
    The following lines should go in your startup script to initialize the dac128V asyn
    server.</p>
  <pre># Initialize Systran DAC
# initDAC128V(char *portName, int carrier, int slot)
# portName  = name to give this asyn port
# carrier     = IPAC carrier number (0, 1, etc.)
# slot        = IPAC slot (0,1,2,3, etc.)
initDAC128V("DAC1", 0, 3)
</pre>
