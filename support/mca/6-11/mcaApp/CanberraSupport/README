This directory contains files from the development version of WinPcap.

They get installed before the CanberraSrc directory is built on Cygwin.

libwcap.a is from the Lib directory in WinPcap

wpcap.h and wpcap-bpf.h are from the Inc directory.  
They are renamed from pcap.h and pcap-bpf.h to avoid conflicts
with system include files on Linux.  wpcap.h is also edited to
change the include from pcap-bpf.h to wpcap-bpf.h.

The versions in this directory now are from the 4.0.2 release of WinPcap.
