Directory structure is:
/sequencer
         /src          *.c, snc.y source of teh compiler and sequencer
             /bck      backup of /src/*.c of a validated version of snc and seq
         /seq          Example snc .st files. Very simple examples of .st files,
                       for demonstrating syntax to new users.
	     /test     Example snc .st files; a little more complicated, used for 
                       validating run-time behaviour. A very brief header in each
                       file describes what they test.
             /bad      Example snc .st files that contain deliberate errors, used 
                       for testing snc compiler error handling. 
	     /bug      Example snc .st files which demonstrate extant bugs in 
                       the version of snc defined in /sequencer/src.
