IPAC and CANbus Driver
======================

    This README file describes ipac, also previously known as drvIpac,
    which is a collection of software for vxWorks to interface to one or
    more Industry Pack carrier boards, and to the TEWS Tip810 CANbus IP
    module.  This software was written for use with EPICS (Experimental
    Physics and Industrial Control System, http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics)
    but the drivers can be compiled and used without the EPICS interface
    if this is desired - see the HTML documentation in the drvIpac and
    drvTip810 directories for some details.


EPICS Support Application Structure
-----------------------------------

    Sites may wish to edit the Makefile found in this directory to change
    the list of module drivers to be built along with the ipac driver.
    Additional driver directories will have to be added to the Makefile
    by hand.  This is intentional to allow the distribution to include
    all of the standard IP module drivers in the future without requiring
    every site to build them all.
