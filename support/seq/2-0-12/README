ANL CVS path: epics/modules/soft/sequencer
------------------------------------------

This is the unbundled version of the EPICS sequencer. It is the version which
has been in use for some years at the W. M. Keck Observatory. It includes
all bug fixes which have been made to the bundled version and in addition
has extensions for queueing monitored values.

It also has some SLAC extensions to support entry{}. exit{} and state options.

The directory tree is organized as a makeBaseApp application.

Directory structure is:

/sequencer

    README		This file (general notes at the top, followed by
			release notes, most recent first)

    /configure		Configuration files (standard for makeBaseApp)

    /src		*.c, snc.y source of the compiler and sequencer

    /docs		Documentation and notes

    /test		Examples and test .st files

	/simple		Very simple examples, for demonstrating syntax to
			new users

	/validate	A little more complicated, used for validating
			run-time behaviour. A very brief header in each
			file describes what they test

        /demo		An application that has a database.
			See demo/README for how to run the demo/

	/bad		Files that contain deliberate errors, used for
			testing snc compiler error handling 

	/bug		Files which demonstrate extant bugs in the version
			of snc defined in /sequencer/src


Remaining directories are auto-generated by the build / install process.

EPICS sequencer v2.0.1 (CVS tag seq-2-0-1)
----------------------

This is a version that has been tested with release 3.14.0alpha2 of base.
The makeBaseApp example includes a sample sequence program.

EPICS sequencer v2.0.0 (CVS tag seq-2-0-0)
----------------------

This is a major new release. It is the first version to use the EPICS
R3.14 OSI (Operating System Independent) layer and the message system
independent PV layer. There are numerous other improvements and the manual
has been nearly completely re-written.

EPICS sequencer v1.9.5 (CVS tag seq-1-9-5)
----------------------

This is v1.9.4 with a fix that once again permits the use of "td" to
delete sequencers from the VxWorks shell.

Also, the magic number has been changed (it should have been changed at
v1.9.4), which means that snc must be re-run on all state programs.

The docs directory now contains Andy Kozubal's manual updated to the
current version (and with some material on the upcoming v2.0). It also
contains the sequencer web page.

EPICS sequencer v1.9.4 (CVS tag seq-1-9-4)
----------------------

This is v1.9.3.p2 plus modifications for entry{}, exit{} and state options.
From this release, version numbers of the form <major>.<minor>.<patchlevel>
are adopted.

EPICS sequencer v1.9.3.p2 (CVS tag seq-1-9-3-p2)
-------------------------

The docs sub-directory will contain the source code of Andy Kozubal's sequencer
manual. This refers to v1.9 of the sequencer and does not describe the above
changes. It will be updated asap to give full documentation of this version.
The doc sub-directory _does_ contain a couple of presentations from the 1996
EPICS collaboration and software sharing meetings.
