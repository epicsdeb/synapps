<h1 align="center">Support for the Acromag IP330ADC<br>
</h1>

<h2 align="center">Authors: Mark Rivers, Joe Sullivan and Marty
Kraimer<br>
</h2>

<h2 align="center">Release 1.6<br>
</h2>

<p>The support for the Ip330 is very general and flexible. It is
based on a 2-layer model. At the lower level is <a href="#Ip330">class
Ip330</a> which knows how to talk to the IP330 hardware, but is
application independent. Above class Ip330 are the
application-specific classes. There are currently 3 such classes:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="#Ip330Scan">Ip330Scan</a> - scanning A/D
        converter application </li>
    <li><a href="#Ip330Sweep">Ip330Sweep</a> - waveform
        recorder/transient digitizer application </li>
    <li><a href="#Ip330PID">Ip330PID</a> - fast PID (feedback)
        application </li>
</ul>

<p>Ip330Scan, Ip330Sweep, and Ip330PID can all be running
simultaneously, and can even all be talking to the same input
channels. It is easy to add additional application-specific
classes as the need arises. </p>

<p>The <a href="#Release">Release notes</a> at the end of this
document describe how to convert from the existing Ip330Scan
support to this package. </p>

<p>The software is available as a <a
href="http://cars.uchicago.edu/software/pub/ip330App.tar">tar file</a>.

<h2 align="center"><a name="Ip330">Class Ip330</a></h2>

<p>At the lowest level there is a class called Ip330. This class
knows how to talk to the IP330 hardware, but does not know how it
will be used. The only parameters of the IP330 module which are
not configurable in this class are the output data format (which
is set to Straight Binary) and the Interrupt Control (which is
set to interrupt after conversion of all selected channels). All
other parameters of the IP330 can be configured (first and last
channels to convert, scan mode, scan rate, trigger signal
direction, etc.) An Ip330Config server is provided together with
device support for modifying configuration parameters. Currently
it only provides the ability to  request calibrationrequest calibration.
MPF servers and EPICS device
support exist for the application-specific classes which sit
above Ip330. </p>

<h3>Ip330 public interface</h3>

<p>This is the public interface of the Ip330 class: </p>

<pre>
class Ip330
{
public:
    static Ip330 * init(
        const char *moduleName, const char *carrierName, const char *siteName,
        const char *type, const char *range, int firstChan, int lastChan,
        int maxClients, int intVec);
    int config(scanModeType scanMode, const char *triggerString, int
        microSecondsPerScan, int secondsBetweenCalibrate);
    int getCorrectedValue(int channel);
    int correctValue(int channel, int raw);
    int getRawValue(int channel);
    int setGain(int gain,int channel);
    int setScanMode(scanModeType scanMode);
    int setTrigger(triggerType trigger);
    float setMicroSecondsPerScan(float microSeconds);
    float getMicroSecondsPerScan();
    void setSecondsBetweenCalibrate(int seconds);
    int registerCallback(Ip330Callback callback, void *pvt);
</pre>

<p>Brief description of these functions: </p>

<ul>
    <li><tt>init()</tt> and <tt>config()</tt> are called from <tt>initIp330</tt>
        and <tt>configIp330</tt> which are discussed below. </li>
    <li><tt>getRawValue()</tt> returns the A/D value for a
        channel without applying the calibration corrections for
        slope and offset. </li>
    <li><tt>getCorrectedValue()</tt> returns the A/D value for a
        channel after applying the calibration corrections for
        slope and offset.
        NOTE: If secondsBetweenCalibrate is less than zero then the raw
        A/D value is returned.
        </li>
    <li><tt>correctValue()</tt> corrects an input raw value for a
        channel by applying the calibration corrections for slope
        and offset.
        NOTE: If secondsBetweenCalibrate is less than zero then the raw
        A/D value is returned.
        </li>
    <li><tt>setGain()</tt> sets the gain for a channel. The
        specified gain must be {0, 1, 2, or 3} corresponding to
        gains of {1, 2, 4, 8}. At initialization the gain of each channel
        is set to 0 and the channel calibrated.
        </li>
    <li><tt>setScanMode()</tt> sets the scan mode of the IP330.
        The scan modes are defined symbolically in <tt>Ip330.h</tt>.
        The most commonly used mode is <tt>burstContinuous</tt>,
        which digitizes all channels from firstChan to lastChan
        at 15 microseconds per channel, and then repeats this at
        an interval controlled by <tt>setMicroSecondsPerScan()</tt>.
    </li>
    <li><tt>setTrigger()</tt> sets the direction of the external
        trigger signal on the IP330 (input or output). The
        trigger directions are defined symbolically in <tt>Ip330.h</tt>.
    </li>
    <li><tt>setMicroSecondsPerScan()</tt> sets the number of
        microseconds per scan loop of the IP330. This time is
        only applicable when the scanMode is <tt>burstContinuous</tt>,
        <tt>uniformContinuous</tt>, or <tt>uniformSingle</tt>.
        This time will be the time between interrupts. It is
        automatically corrected for the 15 microsecond per
        channel conversion time of the IP330. The minimum value
        is equal to <tt>15*(lastChan-firstChan+1)</tt>. </li>
    <li><tt>getMicroSecondsPerScan()</tt> returns the number of
        microseconds per scan loop of the IP330. This value may
        not equal the requested time either because the requested
        time was too short or too long, or because of the
        granularity of the IP330 timer. </li>
    <li><tt>setSecondsBetweenCalibrate()</tt>
        When secondsBetweenCalibrate is given a value
        <ul>
            <li>greater than zero,
                then all channels are calibrated every secondsBetweenCalibrate
                seconds.</li>
            <li>equal to zero, then all channels are calibrated once.</li>
            <li>less than zero then no calibration 
                is done. In addition getCorrectedValue and correctValue both
                return the raw rather than converted value.</li>
        </ul>
    <li><tt>registerCallback()</tt> This function is called by
        application-specific classes to register their interrupt
        functions with Ip330. Ip330 will call the registered
        function every time an interrupt occurs, passing the <tt>pvt</tt>
        pointer, and a pointer to the new data. The <tt>pvt</tt>
        pointer is typically a pointer to the application class
        object. The Ip330 interrupt routine does the following: <ul>
            <li>Saves the floating point context so application
                interrupt functions can do floating point
                operations. </li>
            <li>Copies the data from the mailBox registers to a
                local buffer. </li>
            <li>Calls the interrupt function in each registered
                application class, passing the <tt>pvt</tt>
                pointer, and a pointer to the local copy of the
                data. </li>
            <li>Restores the floating point context. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Ip330 configuration</h3>

<p>The Ip330 is configured by calling the following functions
from the vxWorks startup file. </p>

<pre>
extern &quot;C&quot; Ip330 *initIp330(
    const char *moduleName, const char *carrierName, const char *siteName,
    const char *typeString, const char *rangeString,
    int firstChan, int lastChan,
    int maxClients, int intVec)

# function return value  = pointer to the Ip330 object, needed by configIp330
#                          and to initialize the application-specific classes
# serverName  = name to give this server
# carrierName = name of IPAC carrier from initIpacCarrier above
# siteName    = name of IP site, e.g. &quot;IP_a&quot;
# typeString  = &quot;D&quot; or &quot;S&quot; for differential or single-ended
# rangeString = &quot;-5to5&quot;,&quot;-10to10&quot;,&quot;0to5&quot;, or &quot;0to10&quot;
#               This value must match hardware setting selected
# firstChan   = first channel to be digitized.  This must be in the range:
#               0 to 31 (single-ended)
#               0 to 15 (differential)
# lastChan    = last channel to be digitized
# maxClients =  Maximum number of Ip330 tasks which will attach to this
#               Ip330 module.  For example Ip330Scan, Ip330Sweep, etc.  This
#               does not refer to the number of EPICS clients.  A value of
#               10 should certainly be safe.
# intVec        Interrupt vector

extern &quot;C&quot; int configIp330(
    Ip330 *pIp330,
    scanModeType scanMode, const char *triggerString,
    int microSecondsPerScan, int secondsBetweenCalibrate)

# pIp330      = pointer to the Ip330 object, returned by initIp330 above
# scanMode    = scan mode:
#               0 = disable
#               1 = uniformContinuous
#               2 = uniformSingle
#               3 = burstContinuous (normally recommended)
#               4 = burstSingle
#               5 = convertOnExternalTriggerOnly
# triggerString = &quot;Input&quot; or &quot;Output&quot;. Selects the direction of the external
#               trigger signal.
# microSecondsPerScan = repeat interval to digitize all channels
#               The minimum theoretical time is 15 microseconds times the
#               number of channels, but a practical limit is probably 100
#               microseconds.  Larger values reduce CPU usage, but decrease
#               the number of callbacks per second to the application classes.
#               This will reduce the number of measurments averages in the
#               ip330Scan class,  increase the granularity in the time per
#               point for the ip330Sweep class, and decrease the number of
#               feedback cycles per second for the ip330PID class.
# secondsBetweenCalibrate = number of seconds between calibration cycles.
#               If zero then there will be no periodic calibration, but
#               one calibration will still be done at initialization.
#               If less than zero then no calibration is done.
#               NOTE: setGain also causes a calibration.
</pre>

<p>Note that the reason for having <tt>configIp330</tt>, rather
than just <tt>initIp330</tt> is simply that there are more than
10 configurable parameters, but vxWorks only allows 10 arguments
to be passed to functions which are called from the shell. </p>

<h3>IP330 Hardware setup</h3>

<p>The DIP Switch Settings column correspond to the value of
switches 1 - 10. A value of 1011000010 corresponds to switches
1,3,4,9 on and 2,5,6,7,8,10 off. </p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="Ip330Config">Ip330Config Server</a></h2>

<p>A server and device support are provided to dynamically
change configuration value. Currently this only provides support for
changing setSecondsBetweenCalibrate.

<h3>Ip330Config server configuration</h3>

<pre>
extern &quot;C&quot; int initIp330Config(
    Ip330 *pIp330, const char *serverName, int queueSize)
# pIp330     = pointer returned by initIp330 above
# serverName = name to give this server.  Must match the INP parm field in
#              EPICS records
# queueSize  = size of output queue for MPF. Make this the maximum number 
#              of records attached to this server.
</pre>

<h3>Ip330Config EPICS Device Support</h3>

<p> The current device support is for a longout record.
It sends an Int32Messages with the following info: </p>

<ul>
    <li><tt>cmd</tt></li>
    <li><tt>value</tt></li>
</ul>

<p>Server returns: </p>

 field(OUT,&quot;#C{card} S{signal} @{servername},{cmd}
 card   =       The location of the server
 signal =       Not currently used. Just make the value 0
 servername     Must match the serverName specified with initIp330Config
 cmd		Default is 0,which for now is the only valid value.

 field(VAL)     When the record is processed the value of the VAL field
                is setSecondsBetweenCalibrate. See above for meaning.
</pre>
A typical use is to have a passive longout record.
If the VAL field is 0, then each time the record is processed calibration
will be performed.

<h2 align="center"><a name="Ip330Scan">Class Ip330Scan</a></h2>

    <li><tt>init()</tt> is called from <tt>initIp330Scan</tt>
        which is discussed below. </li>
    <li><tt>getValue()</tt> returns the averaged A/D value for a

        milliseconds to average readings from the IP330 before
        computing the value returned by <tt>getValue()</tt>. The

        upon this value and also upon the value of <tt>microSecondsPerScan</tt>
        specified in the call to <tt>configIp330</tt>.&nbsp; Note that as of
      Release 1.6 this is just the initial time for averaging, and is replaced

to EPICS. Waveform acquisition is started by <tt>startAcquire</tt>.
Acquisition stops whenever one of the following occurs: </p>

<ul>
    <li>The preset time set with <tt>setPresetTime()</tt> is
        reached. </li>
    <li>The preset number of waveform points set with <tt>setNumPoints()</tt>
        is reached. </li>
    <li>Acquisition is explicitly stopped by calling <tt>stopAcquire()</tt>.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Ip330Sweep can acquire multiple waveforms simultaneously, one
for each of the input channels. Acquisition is started and
stopped for all channels simultaneously, and <tt>erase()</tt>
erases all waveforms. </p>

<p>Brief description of these functions: </p>

<ul>
    <li><tt>init()</tt> is called from <tt>initIp330Sweep</tt>
        which is discussed below. </li>
    <li><tt>setGain()</tt> sets the gain for this channel. See <tt>Ip330::setGain()</tt>
        for more information. </li>
    <li><tt>startAcquire()</tt> starts acquiring points. </li>
    <li><tt>stopAcquire()</tt> stops acquiring points. </li>
    <li><tt>erase()</tt> erases the waveform. This sets all of
        the waveform data to 0, sets the elapsed time to 0, and
        resets the next channel pointer to 0. </li>
    <li><tt>setMicroSecondsPerPoint()</tt> sets the time interval
        between waveform points. The actual time interval will be
        an integer multiple of the value of <tt>microSecondsPerScan</tt>
        specified in the call to <tt>configIp330</tt>. </li>
    <li><tt>getMicroSecondsPerPoint()</tt> gets the actual time
        interval between waveform points. The actual time
        interval may not be equal to the time interval requested
        with <tt>setMicroSecondsPerPoint()</tt>, because the
        actual time must be an integer multiple of the value of <tt>microSecondsPerScan</tt>
        specified in the call to <tt>configIp330</tt>. </li>
    <li><tt>setNumPoints()</tt> sets the number of points to be
        acquired in the waveform. This value must be less than <tt>maxPoints</tt>
        specified in the call to <tt>initIp330Sweep()</tt>. </li>
    <li><tt>getNumPoints()</tt> gets the number of points to be
        acquired in the waveform. </li>
    <li><tt>setPresetTime()</tt> sets the maximum acquisition
        time in seconds. The vxWorks system clock is used for
        this timing, so the resolution is typically 1/50 or 1/60
        of a second. The preset time is ignorred if it is zero. </li>
    <li><tt>getElapsedTime()</tt> returns the elapsed acquisition
        time in seconds. The elapsed time is reset to zero when <tt>erase()</tt>
        is called. The vxWorks system clock is used for this
        timing, so the resolution is typically 1/50 or 1/60 of a
        second. </li>
    <li><tt>getStatus()</tt> returns the acquisition status, 1 if
        the unit is acquiring a waveform, 0 if it is not
        acquiring. </li>
    <li><tt>getData()</tt> returns the waveform data for a
        channel. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Ip330Sweep EPICS Device Support</h3>

<p>Device support can send the following messages (MSG_XXX are
defined in mcaApp/src/mca.h): </p>

<p>Float64Messages with the following info: </p>

<ul>
    <li><tt>cmd = MSG_ERASE</tt> - erase waveform </li>
    <li><tt>cmd = MSG_ACQUIRE</tt> - start acquisition </li>
    <li><tt>cmd = MSG_STOP_ACQUISITION</tt> - stop acquisition </li>
    <li><tt>cmd = NSG_SET_NCHAN</tt> - set number of waveform
        points <ul>
            <li><tt>value</tt> - number of channels </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><tt>cmd = MSG_READ</tt> - read data. Server returns an
        Int32ArrayMessage with the data. </li>
    <li><tt>cmd = MSG_GET_ACQ_STATUS</tt> - read status. Server
        returns a Float64ArrayMessage with the elapsed real time,
        elapsed live time, time per point and acquire status. </li>
    <li><tt>cmd = MSG_SET_DWELL</tt> - sets the time per point <ul>
            <li><tt>value</tt> - dwell time per point in seconds </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><tt>cmd = MSG_SET_LIVE_TIME</tt> - sets the preset live
        time <ul>
            <li><tt>value</tt> - preset time in seconds. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><tt>cmd = MSG_SET_REAL_TIME</tt> - sets the preset real
        time. </li>
    <li><ul>
            <li><tt>value</tt> - preset time in seconds. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Preset live time and preset real time are ignorred if they are
zero. There is no difference between live and real time, but
acquisition will stop whenever either preset time is reached.</p>

<p>Standard input record type format is for MCA records. Note
that the MCA record is not part of EPICS base. The MPF device
support for the MCA record, and the MCA record itself are
available separately in the <a

file</a>. </p>

<pre>
 field(DTYP,&quot;MPF MCA&quot;)

 field(NMAX, nchannels)
 nchannels = maximum number of channels (time points) to use for this record.
             NMAX cannot be changed after iocInit.  NMAX should normally be 
             set to the same value specified for maxPoints in initIp330Sweep

 field(NUSE, nchannels)
 nchannels = actual number of channels (time points) to use for this record.
             NUSE can be changed at any time, however it cannot be greater 
             than NMAX or maxPoints specified in initIp330Sweep

 field(DWEL, scan_time)
 scan_time = time per point in seconds (floating point).  Values as small as
             as 1.e-4 (100 microseconds) can be used if 6 or fewer channels 
             are digitized.  The DWEL field will be set to the actual time
             per point, in case the value requested is not available either
             because it is too short or too long, or because the requested
             time was not an integer multiple of the value of 
             microSecondsPerScan specified in the call to configIp330.

 field(INP,&quot;#C{card} S{signal} @{servername})
 card   =       The location of the server
 signal =       The input channel of the ip330ADC
                Differential inputs 0 - 15 are valid
                Single ended inputs 0 - 31 are valid
 servername     Must match the serverName specified with initIp330Sweep

<h2 align="center"><a name="Ip330PID">Class Ip330PID</a></h2>

<p>This class provides very fast PID (feedback) software. It
reads its input from a single channel of the Ip330 and writes its
output to a single DAC channel on the Systran DAC (dac128V which
is in MPF). It can do feedback faster than 1 kHz. It uses exactly
the same feedback algorithm as the soft record device support in
the EPID (Enhanced PID) EPICS record. </p>

    <li><tt>init()</tt> and <tt>config()</tt> are called from <tt>initIp330PID</tt>
        and <tt>configIp330PID</tt> which are discussed below. </li>
    <li><tt>setMicroSecondsPerScan()</tt> sets the time per

        specified in the call to <tt>configIp330</tt>. </li>
    <li><tt>getMicroSecondsPerScan()</tt> gets the actual time
        per feedback loop. The actual time interval may not be
        equal to the time interval requested with <tt>setMicroSecondsPerScan()</tt>,
        because the actual time must be an integer multiple of

    <li><tt>P</tt> (RO) is the proportional term. </li>
    <li><tt>I</tt> (R/W) is the integral term. This term is R/W
        since one may want to force it to zero or another value
        to prevent over/undershoot or to improve response time. </li>
    <li><tt>D</tt> (RO) is the derivative term. </li>
    <li><tt>feedbackOn</tt> (R/W) is 0 is feedback is off, 1 if
        feedback is on. When feedback is off the PID calculation
        still runs, but the computed output is simply not written
        to the DAC. </li>
    <li><tt>lowLimit</tt> (R/W) is the lower limit on the DAC
        output. If the computed output from the PID algorithm is

    </li>
    <li><tt>highLimit</tt> (R/W) is the high limit on the DAC

<p>Note that the reason for having <tt>configIp330PID</tt>,
rather than just <tt>initIp330PID</tt> is simply that there are
more than 10 configurable parameters, but vxWorks only allows 10
arguments to be passed to functions which are called from the

<h3>Ip330PID EPICS Device Support</h3>

<p>Device support sends Float64Messages with the following info: </p>

<ul>
    <li><tt>cmd = cmdStartFeedback</tt> - turn on feedback </li>
    <li><tt>cmd = cmdStopFeedback</tt> - turn off feedback </li>

        is the desired input reading from the ADC channel </li>
    <li><tt>cmd = cmdGetParams</tt> - read the current feedback
        parameters. The server returns a Float64ArrayMessage with
        the following information from Ip330PID: <ul>

                value written to the DAC if feedback is on. </li>
            <li><tt>secondsPerScan</tt>, actual seconds per
                feedback loop. This may differ from the requested
                time because it was too long or too short, or
                because the requested time was not an integer
                multiple of the value of <tt>microSecondsPerScan</tt>

<p>Standard input record type format is for EPID records. Note
that the EPID record is not part of EPICS base, and thus the
lines to compile devEpidIp330.cc are commented out in

             reads back the parameters from the server (P, I, D, error, output,
             etc.)  Thus if SCAN=.1 second then the EPID record provides 10 Hz
             snapshots of the PID feedback, which may actually be occuring at
             1 kHz or faster.  The Ip330Sweep support can be used together with
             the EPICS MCA record to capture the actual ADC input as fast as it

<h2 align="center"><a name="Restriction">Restrictions on Scan
Timing</a></h2>

<p>In an earlier release of this package (1.0) each of the
application-specific classes (Ip330Scan, Ip330Sweep, Ip330PID)
had a function to control the scan rate of the Ip330. However,
there is only a single interval timer in the IP330 hardware, and
so if one class changed the scan rate it would change the scan
rate for all of the other classes. This interaction was
undesirable, and so the behavior has been changed, starting with
release 1.01. Now the value of <tt>microSecondsPerScan</tt>
specified in <tt>configIp330</tt> is never changed by any
application classes. Each application class will have its
callback routine executed at this time interval. The application
class will determine what to do when it is called back. For
example, in the <tt>ip330Sweep</tt> class if <tt>microSecondsPerPoint</tt>
is 1000, and <tt>ip330-&gt;microSecondsPerScan</tt> is 500, then
the <tt>ip330Sweep</tt> callback routine returns immediately
without doing anything on every other call. This behaviour
eliminates any interaction between the timing for the different
application classes. The new limitation is that the granularity
of the time intervals available to an application class is now
limited to the value of <tt>microSecondsPerScan</tt> specified in
<tt>configIp330</tt>, whereas previously the granularity was 8
microseconds. Thus, for example, if <tt>microSecondsPerScan</tt>
is 500 microseconds then the dwell times available in the <tt>ip330Sweep</tt>
class are limited to multiples of 500 microseconds. </p>

<h3>Release 1.0 November 15, 1999</h3>

<p>This support replaces the previous ip330ScanApp. That support
did the following: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Digitized channels 0 to 15 in differential mode, or 0 to
        31 in single-ended mode </li>
    <li>Took a complete set of readings every millisecond.
        Actually the complete set of readings was taken every
        1.240 milliseconds in diffential mode and every 1.480
        milliseconds in single ended mode, because the 15
        microseconds to convert each channel was not taken into
        account when programming the interval timer. </li>
    <li>Averaged 200 samples for each channel. However, there was
        a bug in the software when running in differential mode.
        The data were always read from the lower mailbox
        registers (0-15) rather than alternating the reads
        between the lower and upper mailbox registers. Thus, only
        100 unique values were being averaged in this mode,
        rather than 200. </li>
    <li>Returned the average value to device support, thus every
        0.2 seconds a 200 sample average was supposed to be
        available. </li>
    <li>Once a minute calibration was done automatically. </li>
</ul>

<p>The new support can be configured to function exactly as the
previous support was intended to function with commands like the
following in the MPF server startup file: </p>

<pre>
  pIp330 = initIp330(&quot;c-Ip330&quot;,carrier,&quot;IP_c&quot;,&quot;D&quot;,&quot;-5to5&quot;,0,15,10,120)
  configIp330(pIp330,3,&quot;Input&quot;,1000,60)
  initIp330Scan(pIp330,&quot;c-Ip330Scan&quot;,0,15,200,20)
</pre>

<p>The initIp330 command creates a task called
&quot;c-Ip330&quot;, with the following settings: </p>

<ul>
    <li>differential mode </li>
    <li>-5 to 5 volt range </li>
    <li>convert channels 0 to 15, </li>
    <li>10 clients (Ip330 application-specific servers) maximum </li>
    <li>interrupt vector = 120 </li>
</ul>

<p>The configIp330 command configures Ip330 with the following
settings: </p>

<ul>
    <li>scanMode = 3 = Burst Continuous </li>
    <li>external trigger = input </li>
    <li>1000 microseconds = 1 millisecond per scan </li>
    <li>60 seconds between calibrations </li>
</ul>

<p>The initIp330Scan command creates a server called
&quot;c-Ip330Scan&quot; with the following settings: </p>

<ul>
    <li>connected to the Ip330 object created by the initIp330
        command </li>
    <li>convert channels 0 to 15 </li>
    <li>average readings for 200 milliseconds </li>
    <li>create an output queue for 20 MPF messages </li>
</ul>

<h3>Release 1.01 April 20, 2000</h3>

<p>Changed the timing logic. See the discussion in <a
href="#Restriction">Restrictions on Scan Timing</a>. </p>

<h3>Release 1.02 September 10, 2000</h3>

<p>Changed ip330SweepServer.cc, removed Ip330SweepServer.h, and
replaced devMcaIp330.cc with a device-independent layer,
devMcaMpf.cc. devMcaMpf.cc is part of mcaApp, not part of Ip330,
since it is no longer specific to the Ip330. The messages
accepted by Ip330SweepServer have been changed to accomodate the
new device-independent layer.</p>

<p>Changes to the PID algorithm in ip330PID.cc to improve its
operation. See the comments in ip330PID.cc for details.</p>

<h3>Release 1.1 November 1, 2000 (Marty Kraimer)</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Added the configuration server.</li>
    <li>Added a lock that protects adj_slope and adj_offset
         from being changed while corrected values are computed.</li>
    <li>Force two data acquisition cycles during calibration.
        This is necessary to allow ADC to settle.</li>
    <li>After calibration set mailBoxOffset=16. Caused a bad reading.</li>
    <li>If secondsBetween Calibrate<0 then return raw value.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Release 1.2 January 16, 2001</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Fixed a bug which caused the IOC to crash if the external trigger line
        was asserted during a hardware reboot.
    <li>Fixed bugs which caused the IOC to crash if the IP330 hardware was not
        installed but server configuration commands were present in the startup file.
</ul>

<h3>Release 1.3 August 28, 2001</h3>

<ul>
    <li>                 Removed calls to intClear and intDisable. These were not necessary and did not work on dumb IP carrier.<br>
</ul>

<h3>Release 1.4 October 12, 2001</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Added code to handle soft reboots.<br>
</ul>

<h3>Release 1.5 July 31, 2002 (Carl Lionberger and Eric Snow at SNS)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>                 Moved interrupt enable to end of config.&nbsp; It was
    generating lots of interrupts before being fully configured.</li>
  <li>Properly masked mode control bits in setScanMode, was not working in modes
    other than burstContinuous</li>
  <li>Adjusted mailBoxOffset for uniformSingle and burstSingle scan modes in intFunc.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Release 1.6 March 31, 2003</h3>
<ul>
  <li>                 Changed the way averaging is done in the ip330Scan
    class.&nbsp; Previously there was a single averaging time for all input
    channels, that was set at boot time with the milliSecondsToAverage parameter
    in the call to initIp330Scan().&nbsp; This was not the best way to do it,
    since if an ai record was set to process every 2 seconds, but
    milliSecondsToAverage was 100 msec, then the ai record would just be
    sampling every 20'th average.&nbsp; A much better way to do it is to have
    the averaging time be equal to the scan time of the record, so that if the
    scan time is 2 seconds then the averaging is done for 2 seconds, greatly
    improving signal to noise.&nbsp; This has now been implemented by making the
    averaging time be independent for each input channel, and passing the scan
    time in the &quot;extra&quot; field of the message from device support to
    the server.&nbsp; Note that there is a limitation in the way this is
    presently implemented:&nbsp; it only works if the &quot;standard&quot; EPICS
    scan times of 10, 5, 2, 1, .5, .2 and .1 seconds are used.&nbsp; If a site
    changes these scan times it will not work correctly, because there is no API
    available to determine the actual scan time of a record.</li>
</ul>
