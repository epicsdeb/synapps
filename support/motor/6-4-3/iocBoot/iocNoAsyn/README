To build any examples;

- in <motor>/configure/RELEASE: EPICS_BASE, TEMPLATE_TOP and MSI must
	be defined.

- in <motor>/Makefile: the following two lines must be uncommented;
	#!DIRS := $(DIRS) $(filter-out $(DIRS), motorExApp)
	#!DIRS := $(DIRS) $(filter-out $(DIRS), iocBoot)

To build the OMS example in this directory;
- in <motor>/motorApp/Makefile: #!DIRS += OmsSrc must be uncommented.

- in <motor>/motorExApp/Makefile: #!DIRS += NoAsyn must be uncommented.

- in <motor>/motorExApp/NoAsyn/Makefile: #!NoAsynVx_LIBS += oms must be
	uncommented.

Finally, cd <motor>; gnumake clean uninstall; gnumake


To run the MX example, uncomment the following;
in <motor>/motorExApp/NoAsyn/Makefile: #NoAsyn_LIBS += MXmotor
in <motor>/motorExApp/NoAsyn/NoAsynInclude.dbd: #include "devMXmotor.dbd" 
and rebuild.

Assuming the EPICS_HOST_ARCH environment variable is set correctly,
start the ioc from this directory by executing the following command.

../../bin/${EPICS_HOST_ARCH}/NoAsyn st.cmd.mx
