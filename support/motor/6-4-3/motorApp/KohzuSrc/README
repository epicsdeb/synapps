Known problems:

- The Stop command (STP) does not respond until the axis is completely stopped.
From the SC-800 Operation Manual; "Response is transmitted at the time when
the axis completely stops."  This results in "recv_mess(): TIMEOUT" error
messages if the deceleration time is near the communication timeout (3 sec.).

- With the motor record base speed (VBAS field) set to zero, the controller
takes approximately 5-6 seconds to finish even a small move.

- The home search can only be started in the positive direction.
