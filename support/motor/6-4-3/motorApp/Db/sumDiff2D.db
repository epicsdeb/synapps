# This database implements a generic 2-D coordinate transformation.  Given two
# real motors $(P)$(M1DRV) and $(P)$(M1DRV), which move parallel to each other,
# it will move two soft motors $(P)$(SUM) and $(P)$(DIFF) as the weighted 
# average and difference of the two real motors.  The weighting factors are 
# as follows:
# SUM = (( $(P)$(M1DRV) * $(P)$(SUM)C1 ) + ( $(P)$(M2DRV) * $(P)$(SUM)C2 )) /
#       ( $(P)$(SUM)C1) + $(P)$(SUM)C2 )
# DIFF = (( $(P)$(M1DRV) - $(P)$(M2DRV) ) * ( $(P)$(DIFF)C1 )
# Thus the SUM C1 and C2 terms are the "distances" from the center and the 
# DIFF C1 term is a units conversion, e.g. to degrees for a rotation system.

# These two records are where the soft motors write their output.
# They are needed because writing to a transform record field does not
# cause the record to process?
# We use forward links to the transform record (rather than making the INPA and
# INPB fields of the transform record CP) so that the scan record waits 
# for the motors to move.

# This is because the .DVAL fields are always correct, while the DVAL records
