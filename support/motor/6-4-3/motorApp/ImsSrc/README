==============================================================================

Configuring MDrive for party mode.
----------------------------------

The following is a modified version of the procedure defined in Section 2.1,
"Multiple MDrive Motion Control System (Party Mode)", page #27, of the
"MDrive Motion Control" manual; Revision 01.24.2005.

1. Connect the first MDrive Motion Control to the Host PC configured for Single
        Mode Operation. Since the MDrive uses RS-485, a RS-232 to RS-485
	converter is required for a Host PC to MDrive communication connection.
	Set the PC Host RS-232 port characteristics to 9600 Baud, 8 Data bits,
	1 Stop bit, No parity, No flow control.
	
2. Establish communications.
	If you can see the sign-on message "Copyright 2001-2003 by Intelligent
	Motion Systems, Inc.", then you are up and running.  If the sign-on
	message does not appear, try using a software reset.  Hold down the
	"Ctrl" key and press "C" (^C). If the sign-on message still does not
	appear then there may be a problem with either the connections,
	hardware or software configuration of the MDrive Motion Control or
	Host.

3. Using the command DN, name the MDrive Motion Control. This must be a number
        1-9. (DN="1"{enter}). Label the motor with the device name.

4. Define the plus, minus and home limit switches, if available, using the
	S<1-4> command.

5. Set Echo Mode EM=2{enter}.

6. Set the party flag PY=1{enter}.

7. Type CTRL+J to activate the Party Mode.

8. Type {DN}S CTRL+J where {DN} is the device name given in step #3 (Save
        device name, Echo mode, I/O Setup and Party Mode).

9. Remove power.

10. Repeat steps 1 through 8 for each additional MDrive in the system using
        successive device names "1" through "9".
	

IMPORTANT NOTES
---------------

1. The EPICS motor record does NOT support the optional encoder mode.  The
	Encoder Enable Flag (EE) must be 0.


MDrive Facts
------------

* Default step resolution -  51,200 steps / 1 motor revolution (MS=256).
* Encoder resolution - 2048 ticks / 1 motor revolution.


                             IM483
==============================================================================


Configuring IM483's for Party Mode communication.
------------------------------------------------

The following is a modified version of the procedure defined in the
"Communication" section, page #9, of the "Software Reference Manual"; Revision
051794.

1) Power down the IM483's.  Configure each IM483 module for stand alone (single
mode) communications.  For the APS Diviero chassis, jumper J4 for Stand Alone
(1-2) and J7 for Master (1-2).

2) Connect an RS-232 serial connection (9600,none,8,1) from a host terminal to
the first ("A") controller's front panel connector.

3) Power up the IM483.

4) Assign the axis name.  At the host terminal, enter the letter "A" (0x41)
followed by a space charter (0x20).

5) The IM483 controller should respond by echoing the "A" character and the
sign-on message at the host terminal, i.e.,

A   1342     4038 ADVANCED MICRO SYSTEMS, INC
MAX-2000 v1.15i

6) Change the "Limit Polarity" to active high.  At the host terminal, enter
"l1<enter>".  The IM483 should echo your input at the host terminal.

7) Store parameters.  At the  host  terminal, enter "S<enter>".

8) Move RS-232 connection to next controller.  At the host terminal, enter
control c (^c).  Repeat steps 4 through 7 while incrementing the axis name
(i.e, A, B, C, etc.).

9) Set all the IM483's for Party Mode communication.  For the APS Diviero
chassis, configure all of the IM483's for Party Mode by setting J4 to (2-3).
Connect the RS-232 port to the Master IM483 and set all the remaining IM483's
to Slave mode by setting J7 to (2-3).


SSCAN THROUGH-PUT NOTES
-----------------------

The following results where done using the following;

- SSCAN support module R2.5.1, with scan.db configured as follows;
     - Read(R1PV)  set to "time".
     - Drive(P1PV) set to motor record VAL field.
     - #PTS(NPTS)  set to 1000.
     - Step Size(P1SI) set to MRES of the motor record.
- Motor record R5.7; configured as follows;
     - Set slew velocity (VELO) 5.0 = (500 * MRES).
     - Set base velocity (VBAS) 4.9 = (499 * MRES).
     - Acceleration time (ACCL) does not matter.
- EPICS base R3.14.7
- WRS Tornado 2.2.1
- MVME5100
- IM483SM with firmware version; 1342 4038 AMS, INC MAX-2000 v1.15i

KNOWN PROBLEMS
==============

- The MDrive overshoots the target position on small moves when the velocity
base is large.
