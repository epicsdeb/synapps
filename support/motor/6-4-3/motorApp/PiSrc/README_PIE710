Position Resolution:  0.0001 micrometers
Effective Resolution: 0.01 (holding position)

Setup:
     Position Error Tolerance Setting (Memory address 64)
	This parameter controls the "On Target" flag (GI8) that is 
        used to determine DONE. If the tolerance is too large the 
	motorRecord will see DONE before the drive has reached 
        it target position. 

	Set the tolerance parameter to the retry deadband. 

	<axis>DP0,64DR<#.###>  - sets RAM 
	<axis>DP-1,64DR<#.###> - sets EERAM <used on power cycle>

	example:
	1DP0,64DR0.01   - set tolerance to 0.01 um
	1DP-1,64DR0.01

	Status Byte:
		Bit 0: 0 = Servo on, 1 = Servo off 
                Bit 1: 0 = Piezo voltage inside limits,1 = Piezo voltage at limit 
                Bit 2: 0 = On Target: Position error smaller than tolerance 1 = Position error too large 
                Bit 3: 0 = Target position higher than low limit, 1 = Target Position at low limit 
                Bit 4: 0 = Target position smaller than high limit, 1 = Target position at high limit. 
                Bit 5: 0 = AutoZero is not running 1 = AutoZero is running 
                Bit 6: not used 
                Bit 7: 0 = no error, 1 = last sent command not accepted, error during command processing.
