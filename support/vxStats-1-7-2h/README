How to Use VX Stat Support on Your IOC
======================================

* config/RELEASE   

R1-7-2
Add fully instantiated MACRO-ized database, "vxStats-template.db":
Creates a template database that only requires one substitution parameter; (i.e. the IOC's Name). 
This will allow users to reference vxStats-template.db to use with dbLoadRecords 
and substitute the for the MACRO at boot time. 
The other option is to reference vxStats-template.db and make a call to msi 
for macro substitution to create a fully instantiated databases"



R1-7-1
Add records for all netStackSysPool and netStackDataPool cluster fields.
Add records for mbuf totals for each Pool.
Add records for ifShow input and output errors.
Remove vxWorks Variable device type dependency.

R1-6-10
Add additional formats for timestamp string:
We will add a $(P)TimeShort -- "HH:MM:SS"
We will also add a $(P)TimeMed -- "MM/DD/YY HH:MM:SS:ns"
This will be useful for edm screens that display time
and don't want to take up to much real-estate.

R1-6-9
Change time stamp date format to display year.


R1-6-8
Change ASG for "$(P):Access_Cmd" to 
"CHIEF_OPRS". Only the Chief operators can
change the security access mode of operational
IOCs. This PV occurs in reboot.db and reboot.template



R1-6-7
DTYP was not defined for "$(P):Boot_Ena"
DTYP should "Soft Channel"  this was causing
problems for Dave Thompson's utility module.

R1-6-6
Adjust size of text region to accomodate
different security modes on the "IOC_Status.edl"
screen.


R1-6-5
Inside of RELEASE file changed the curly braces to
paren for EPICS_BASE_RELEASE.

R1-6-4
Point to new Release of timestampRecord R1-3.
Dave Thompson made some improvements to the
timestampRecord


R1-6-3
Added DOL to mbbo record so that upon reboot
it comes in the OPERATIONS state and valid.
Without using DOL and PINI the mbbo record comes
up as invalid after a reboot.


R1-6-2:
Changed to version R1-2 in the RELEASE file


R1-6-1:
Use production release of time stamp record
support R1-2


R1-6: unbundle timeStampRecord support
Changed CA security bo record to an mbbo
record to support more IOC states.
Decoupled Channel Access related screens from the Reboot 
EDM Screens



Add
VX_STATS=$(SHARE_RELEASE)/vxStats/R1-1

* In main application's baseLIBOBJS      
Assert that the same-name vx stat support from EPICS
base is NOT included by e.g. commenting it out:

#LIBOBJS += $(EPICS_BASE_BIN)/devVXStats.o  

* In your main application's src/Makefile.Vx,
include the VX Stats binaries:
LIBOBJS += $(VX_STATS_BIN)/vxStatsLib  

* In your main application's dbd file,
include the DBD description:

include "vxStats.dbd"

* Use the vx stats template
vxStatsApp/Db/ioc.substitutions explains
the template files and macro names.

Example use: create a substitutions file like this:

# Coerce vxStat templates into something
# that accepts LLRF marcos S, SS, N

file stats.template
{
    {P=$(S)_$(SS):IOC$(N),
        HMM=50000000,WMM=500000,AMM=100000,
        HCP=100,WCP=50,ACP=80,
        HCL=200,WCL=100,ACL=175,
        HCX=2000,WCX=1000,ACX=1750,
        HFD=150,WFD=20,AFD=5,WMB=50,AMB=10}
}
file reboot.template
{
    {P=$(S)_$(SS):IOC$(N),T=3}
}

Tell the Makefile.Host to use that template 
and expand it into a DB file:
#----------------------------------------------------
# Add databases, templates, substitutions like this
DB +=  stat_llrf.db

#----------------------------------------------------
# Declare template files which do not show up in DB
USES_TEMPLATE += $(VX_STATS)/db/stats.template
USES_TEMPLATE += $(VX_STATS)/db/reboot.template
                              
* EDM
You can use the "IOC_Status.edl" that comes
with vx stats. It requires a "P" macro.
When following the above template, set
P=$(S)_$(SS):IOC$(N)
