This directory contains simadsc (simadsc.*), a library providing a simulation
of the control of an ADSC detector.

This directory also contains header files (detcon_*.h) from the ADSC
detcon_lib_th library.  When using the ADSC detcon_lib_th library (to control
a real detector), the header files included with it should be used, not these.

The ADSC detcon_lib_th header files here were copied from the following
locations in the ADSC detector control software package:

  src_std/detcon_lib_th/detcon_entry.h
  src_std/incl/detcon_par.h
  src_std/incl/detcon_state.h

By default, simadsc does not write simulated images to disk.  However, it does
support a rudimentary way to do so via the environment variable
SIMADSC_XRAY_IMAGE.  If this variable is set to the full file name of an image
(e.g. "/tmp/thaumatin.img"), simadsc, when asked to acquire an image, will
read the image specified in SIMADSC_XRAY_IMAGE and write its contents to disk
as the acquired image.  Setting SIMADSC_XRAY_IMAGE to the empty string or not
setting it at all disables this functionality.
