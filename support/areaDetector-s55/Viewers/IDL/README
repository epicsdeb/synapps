This directory contains IDL source code for controlling EPICS areaDetector
detectors, and for reading the netCDF files written by the NDPluginFile plugin.

It also contains a standalone IDL file, epics_ad_display.sav, to run the 
epics_ad_display GUI to display images from areaDetector detectors.
This file can be run for free on any Linux or Windows system under
the IDL Virtual Machine, which can be downloaded free of charge
from http://www.ittvis.com/idl

This directory also contains the shareable libraries used to
call EPICS Channel Access from IDL (ezcaIDL.dll for Windows
and libezcaIDL.so for Linux).

Before using the IDL source code or .sav file it is necessary
to define the environment variable EZCA_IDL_SHARE to point to the complete
path to ezcaIDL.dll or libezcaIDL.so.  For example on Linux:

setenv EZCA_IDL_SHARE /home/epics/support/areaDetector/1-4/Viewers/IDL/libezcaIDL.so

On Windows use My Computer/Properties/Advanced/Environment Variables/ to add a new
environment variable EZCA_IDL_SHARE to point to the location of ezcaIDL.dll on your
system.

To run the standalone IDL epics_ad_display.sav file without an IDL license exectute the
following on Linux:

idl -32 -vm=epics_ad_display.sav

When the GUI comes up type the base PV name for the NDStdArrays plugin for your
detector in the "Base PV" widget.  For example with the simulation detector supplied 
with the areaDetector application this is "13SIM1:image1:" (without the quotes).  
Once the detector begins acquiring images they should be displayed in the IDL window.

On Windows you can just double click on the epics_ad_display.sav file and
it will start the GUI.  Again type the base PV name for the NDStdArrays plugin
in the "Base PV" widget.

To run the GUI from the IDL command line on a system with an IDL license
type the epics_ad_display command followed by the base PV name of the
NDStdArrays plugin.  For example:

IDL> epics_ad_display, '13SIM1:image1:'
