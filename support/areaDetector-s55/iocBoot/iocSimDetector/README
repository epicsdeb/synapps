This IOC can run on different platforms.  

To run on win32-x86 with st.cmd.win32 run edit Makefile to set ARCH to win32-x86, 
then run "make clean", "make".  That will create envPaths.  Copy that file to envPaths.win32.

To run on linux-x86 with st.cmd.linux run edit Makefile to set ARCH to linux-x86, 
then run "make clean", "make".  That will create envPaths.  Copy that file to envPaths.linux.
