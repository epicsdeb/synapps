# Make any application-specific changes to the EPICS build
# configuration variables in this file.  Do this before building.
# If you change it after building, the safest course is to do a complete
# rebuild.

# Host/target specific settings can be specified in files named
#  CONFIG_SITE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).Common
#  CONFIG_SITE.Common.$(T_A)
#  CONFIG_SITE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).$(T_A)

# Set this when you only want to compile this application
# for a subset of the cross-compiled target architectures
# that Base is built for.

# Set this when your IOC and the host use different paths
# to access the application. This will be needed to boot
# from a Microsoft FTP server or with some NFS mounts.
