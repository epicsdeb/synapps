# NOTE: The build does not check dependancies on files

# each time EPICS_BASE, SNCSEQ, or any other external
# module defined in the RELEASE file is rebuilt.

# If you don't want to install into $(TOP) then
# define INSTALL_LOCATION_APP here
#INSTALL_LOCATION_APP=<fullpathname>

#If using the sequencer, point SNCSEQ at its top directory:
# SNCSEQ=$(EPICS_BASE)/../modules/src/seq

# EPICS_BASE usually appears last so other apps can override stuff:
