<P>
The MCA record controls and acquires data from a multichannel analyzer
(MCA). The MCA record is unlike most other EPICS records in that its
processing is neither "synchronous" nor "asynchronous" (as these terms
are used in the EPICS Record Reference Manual).  Currently, PACT is
always FALSE after record processing has completed, even though a read
operation may be pending a callback from device support.

<TD>The data array of the MCA.  
The data type of the array is set by the FTVL field.  The maximum size of
this array is determined by the NMAX field at IOC initialization.  The actual
array length used is determined by the NUSE field.
Note: Current device support only permits reading of
this field, but future enhancements may permit writing to this field.</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD>BG</TD> <TD>R/W*</TD> <TD>"Background"</TD> <TD>DBF_xxx (array)</TD>
<TD>
Array into which the record writes background data that it calculates
from the data array and from regions of interest defined by the
fields RnLO and RnHI (see, e.g., R0LO, R0HI below).
<P>
The record also uses this array to show the user where ROIs are:
The first and last channels of an ROI are set to the largest value in
the data array.  The intervening channels are set to the background
values calculated for those channels.  This behavior is intended
to help users set ROIs using a generic channel-access client.</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD>ACQG</TD> <TD>R</TD> <TD>"Acquiring"</TD> <TD>DBF_MENU</TD>
<TD>
The current acquire status of the hardware.  ACQG will be 1 ("Acquire") while data
acquisition is underway, and 0 ("Done") otherwise.
When this field goes from 1 to 0, meaning that data acquisition is finished,
a read operation (see READ/RDNG below) is initiated.  
</TD>

<TD>PROC</TD> <TD>R/W*</TD> <TD>"Process Record"</TD> <TD>DBF_MENU</TD>
<TD>
Puts to the PROC field initiate record processing.  When the MCA record processes
it reads the status of the MCA hardware (acquire done/busy, elapsed time, etc.),
but does not read the MCA data. 
When the user sets PROC to 1, a read status command will be sent
to the hardware.  If that command is correctly acknowledged, the RDNS
field (below) will be set to 1 ("Read").  When record processing completes
the RDNS field is set to 0 ("Done").
</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD>RDNS</TD> <TD>R</TD> <TD>Reading status</TD> <TD>DBF_MENU</TD>
<TD>
Puts to the PROC field [above] initiate reading of the MCA's status.
When the user sets PROC to 1, a read status command will be sent
to the hardware.  If that command is correctly acknowledged, the RDNS
field (below) will be set to 1 ("Read").  When record processing completes
the RDNS field is set to 0 ("Done").
This field is intended for use with MCAs that require
asynchronous device support.

When the user sets READ to 1 ("Read"), a read command will be sent
to the hardware.  If that command is correctly acknowledged, the RDNG
field (below) will be set to 1 ("Read").  When device support sets READ 
to 0 ("Done") and triggers record processing, the
read operation is finished, and the RDNG field is set to

field will be set to 1 ("Read").  When device support sets READ to 0 ("Done")
and triggers record processing, the
read operation is finished, and the RDNG field is set to

</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD>CHAS</TD> <TD>R/W*</TD> <TD>Channel-advance source</TD> <TD>DBF_MENU</TD>
<TD>
If the MCA is in "MCS" (multichannel scaler) mode (see MODE),
put's to this field tell the hardware whether to advance the
current channel according to its internal clock (CHAS = 0 or
"Internal"), or in response to an external channel-advance signal
(CHAS = 1 or "External).  (See the DWEL field.)

<TD>DBF_LONG</TD>
<TD>
Put's to this field tell the hardware which memory region to use for data
acquisition, readout and erasing.  The main use of this field is for
time-resolved spectroscopy, since it permits rapidly changing the location 
of data acquisition, without having to read and erase the acquisition memory 
between successive spectra.

Pre-scale factor when the hardware is in "MCS"

<TD>DBF_FLOAT</TD>
<TD>

<TD>MODE</TD> <TD>R/W*</TD> <TD>"Mode PHA/MCS/LIST"</TD> 
<TD>DBF_MENU</TD>
<TD>
Puts to this field tell the hardware in what mode to acquire
data--what to do when an "event" occurs.  (An event is a hardware
trigger that may also clock a digital word into the MCA.)
<P>
MODE=0 ("PHA") is "pulse-height analysis" mode:  each number
presented to the hardware is interpreted as the number of the
channel whose contents are to be incremented by one.
<P>
MODE=1 ("MCS") is "multichannel scaler" mode:  the MCA maintains a
"current channel" number, which increases either with time or in
response to a channel-advance signal (see the CHAS and DWEL
fields), and increments the current channel's contents by one (or
by the number presented to the MCA input, depending on the
hardware) on each event.
<P>
MODE=2 ("List") is "list" mode:  the MCA simply records each event
in the data array.

(RnLO >= 0) and (RnHI >= RnLO), then the record will calculate
a linear background under the channel range [RnLO..RnHI] (including
channels RnLO and RnHI), sum over this range of channels, post
the sum in the field Rn, and post the sum less background in the
field RnN.  The background at channel RnLO is calculated as the
average over 2m+1 channels centered on RnLO, where 'm' is the value
of the field RnBG.  The background at RnHI is calculated similarly,
and the background in the region between RnLO and RnHI is a linear
interpolation.

<H2><A NAME="Intended Use">
             Intended Use</A></H2>
<P>
This record should normally have its SCAN field set to "Passive", since
Put's to the STRT and READ fields are intended to cause data acquisition and
data reading to begin immediately, and since Put's to these "process-passive"
fields can trigger record processing only if the record is passive.
<P>
To read data periodically while acquisition is underway, arrange for a '1'
to be poked into the READ field periodically.  The following recipe arranges
for the READ field to be poked periodically while the MCA is acquiring data.
<P>
<OL>
<LI> attach the output link of a "binary-out" (BO) record to the MCA record's
READ field,
<LI> set the BO record's value permanently to 1 (using its DOL field), 
<LI> attach the BO record's scan-disable link (DISL) to the MCA record's
ACQG field,
<LI> set the BO record's scan-disable value (DISV) to 0.
<LI> set the BO record's SCAN field to the desired update rate.
</OL>

<P>
Similarly, to read status periodically while acquisition is underway, arrange for a '1'
to be poked into the PROC field periodically.  The following recipe arranges
for the PROC field to be poked periodically while the MCA is acquiring data.
<P>
<OL>
<LI> attach the output link of a "binary-out" (BO) record to the MCA record's
PROC field,
<LI> set the BO record's value permanently to 1 (using its DOL field), 
<LI> attach the BO record's scan-disable link (DISL) to the MCA record's
ACQG field,
<LI> set the BO record's scan-disable value (DISV) to 0.
<LI> set the BO record's SCAN field to the desired update rate.
</OL>

<P>
The file mca.db contains records to implement the above logic.  It also contains records
for Start and EraseStart that optionally set a Busy record flag to wait for a channel
access client, such as IDL, to save the data before continuing.  That database also
contains a set of records to indicate why acquisition was stopped (preset time reached,
user stopped it manually, etc.).
