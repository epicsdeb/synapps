<A NAME="Overview">
<H2>Overview</H2></A>
<P>
This device support works with both the Struck STR7201 and the SIS3801 VME
modules.  The STR7201 is a module previously manufactured by Struck, and now by
Bastian, which bought out Struck.  The SIS modules are manufactured by SIS,
which is a new company run by former Struck employees.  Both are a VME modules
with 32 (Struck 7201 and SIS3801) or 8 (SIS3808)) scaler input channels.  In
this document the term STR7201 includes all of the above modules, except where
explicitly noted.

Each input can count at 100MHz or 200MHz depending on model.  It has an
external channel advance input (called Next) which causes the the current
scaler values to be copied to a FIFO, clears the scalers and resumes counting. 
The scalers are implemented in a dual-bank design, so that the switching time
is less than 4 nsec. <P>

The device support for the MCA record is written to support the use of the
STR7201 as a multichannel scaler.  Up to 32 records can be connected to each
unit, each record corresponding to one of the signal inputs.
<P>
The STR7201 hardware itself is not a multichannel scaler in the conventional
sense, since it simply contains a FIFO of scaler counts, rather than an
array of memory locations which hold the counts for each dwell cycle.
The device support for the STR7201 simulates a conventional MCS by allocating
a memory buffer which contains the counts in each dwell period.  The device
support copies the counts from the FIFO to this memory buffer.  
<P>
Each FIFO word
contains the counts for one input signal for one dwell period.  Available FIFO
chips can hold from 2K to 32K words.  
The FIFO can thus buffer anywhere from 64 dwell cycles (32
active inputs, 2K FIFO) to 32,768 dwell cycles (1 active input, 32K FIFO).  The
minimum dwell time is in the range .5-4 microseconds, depending upon the number
of active inputs.

The present device support routines assume that something is causing at least
one record attached to each card to process fast enough to prevent FIFO
overflow.  In the near future VME interrupts will be implemented, so that FIFO
readout will be done automatically when the FIFO is half full.  Even with
interrupts there is a possibility of FIFO overflow with very short dwell times
and small FIFO sizes.  Users whose applications require short dwell 
times and a large
number of active inputs should 
purchase large FIFO chips to prevent this.  The FIFO chip can be replaced in the
field. The device support determines the FIFO
size automatically.  
<P>
<A NAME="Hardware">
<H2>Hardware Configuration</H2></A>
<P>
Jumper J600 on the board must be set to select LCA file 2 (STR7201 Design 1) or
LCA file 3 (STR7201 Design 2).  With Design 1 selected the scalers are 32 bits
wide.  With Design 2 selected the scalers are 24 bits wide, and the upper 8
bits of each data word contain information on the channel number, bank, and 2
user bits.  The channel number and bank information are redundant since the
device support sorts the FIFO output by channel number when copying the data to
the buffer and then to the MCA record.  
However, some applications may want to use the 2 user bits
which are latched with each Next cycle, and Design 2 may be selected for those
applications.
<P>
The device support requires that the board be configured for VME A32
addressing, so jumper EN_A32 must be in place.  Address selection is done with
jumper J_A11, and switches SW_A32U, SW_A32L, SW_A24 and SW_A16. 
The software default address is 0xA0000000.  Note that the factory-default 
address of 0x33508000 cannot be used since this part of the VME A32 address
space is not accessible with the APS version of the vxWorks board support 
package.  Each board takes up 2K bytes of A32 address space, so systems with
multiple cards must configure card N at base address + 2K*N.  For example, if
using the default base address of 0xA0000000 the second card would be set to
address 0xA00000800 (jumper J_A11 removed).
<P>
The device support software configures the control inputs in Mode 2, which
means:
<UL>
<LI> Input 1 = Next (External channel advance)
<LI> Input 2 = EXT1 (External user bit 1)
<LI> Input 3 = EXT2 (External user bit 2)
<LI> Input 4 = DIS  (Disable counting)
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="Record">
<H2>MCA Record Fields</H2></A>
<P>
The device support for the STR7201 defines the INP field to be type VME_IO,
and uses the normal "card" and "signal" conventions.  A card is a single
STR7201 module.  Each module supports up to 32 signals (0-31), corresponding 
to the 32 inputs.  Each MCA record is connected to one of these signal inputs.
<P>
The STRT, STOP and ERAS fields act on <B>all</B> records which are
connected to a particular card.  Thus it is only necessary to issue these
commands to one record in order to start, stop or erase all other records.

<P>
Acqusition will be stopped for <B>all</B> records connected to a particular 
card whenever one or more of the following conditions is satisfied:
<UL>
<LI> The STOP field of any record is set to 1.

<LI> The preset time is reached. The preset time is defined as the larger of 
PRTM or PLTM.  This condition is only checked if PRTM or PLTM is greater than
0.

<LI> The preset counts in a range of channels is reached. This condition is
defined as the sum of the counts between channels 
PCTL and PCTH <B>summed over all active inputs </B> being 
greater than or equal to 
PCT.  This condition is only checked if PCT is greater than zero.

<LI> The preset number of "sweeps" (PSWP) is reached.  A "sweep" is defined as
the receipt of NUSE Next pulses.  This condition is only checked if PSWP is
greater than 0.

</UL>

<P>
The CHAS field is not implemented, since the STR7201 only
supports external channel advance.
<P>
The SEQ field is not implemented, since the device inherently has a fast time
axis.
<P> 
The DWEL field will be implemented soon, when a new version of the firmware
implements a built-in prescaler.
<P> The MODE field is not implemented, since the STR7201 can only operate in
MCS mode.
<P>

<A NAME="Startup">
<H2>vxWorks Startup Script</H2></A>
There are 2 functions which are intended to be called from the vxWorks 
startup script before iocInit.
<UL>

<LI>
<CODE>STR7201Setup(int numCards, int baseAddress, int interruptVector, int
interruptLevel)</CODE>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>numCards</CODE> is the maximum number of STR7201 cards in the 
VME crate.  The
default value is 4 and the memory usage for unused cards is very small.
<LI><CODE>baseAddress</CODE> is the base address of the first STR7201.  The
default is 0xA0000000.  The card must be configured to reside in the A32 
VME address space.
<LI><CODE>interruptVector</CODE> is the interrupt vector of the first
STR7201.  The default is 220 (decimal).  
<LI><CODE>interruptLevel</CODE> is the VME interrupt level. The default is 6.
</UL>
<P>
If the default values of <CODE>numCards</CODE>,
<CODE>baseAddress</CODE>, <CODE>interruptVector</CODE>, and 
<CODE>interruptLevel</CODE> are all acceptable 
then <CODE>STR7201Setup</CODE> does not have to
be called from the vxWorks startup script.
<P>
<LI>
<CODE>STR7201Config(int card, int maxSignals, int maxChans)</CODE>
<P>
This function <B>must</B> be called for each STR7201 card to configure it.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>card</CODE> is the number of the card being configured, 
in the range 0 to <CODE>numCards-1</CODE>.

<LI><CODE>maxSignals</CODE> is the number of input signals 
which will be used, in
the range 1 to 32.  <CODE>maxSignals</CODE> controls how many scaler values
will be copied to the FIFO each time a Next signal is received.  Set this
value to the actual number of signals actually being used to conserve
FIFO memory on the card and vxWorks buffer memory in the driver. 
The number of MCA records which
can be attached to this card is also controlled by <CODE>maxSignals</CODE>.

<LI><CODE>maxChans</CODE> is the maximum number of channels (time points)
which which will be used in any MCA record connected to this card.  The number
of bytes of vxWorks buffer memory allocated by the driver for this card is 
<CODE>maxChans * maxSignals * 4</CODE>, so set this value to the actual maximum
number of channels to be used in any record to conserve memory.
</UL>
</UL>
<A NAME="Files">
<H2>Files</H2></A>
STR7201 support is provided in 3 files, <CODE>devSTR7201.c</CODE>, 
<CODE>drvSTR7201.c</CODE> and <CODE>drvSTR7201.h</CODE>.  
These files can all be
obtained in a 
<A HREF="pub/SIS380x.tar">
tar file</A>.  This file should be untarred in a top level
application directory, <CODE>yourApp</CODE>.  There are only 2 files which are
specific to the STR7201, but it does require a recent version of the MCA
record, so I have also tarred up 
<A HREF="pub/mcaApp.tar">
the complete directory</A>.
<P>
<CODE>devSTR7201.c</CODE>
contains the device support.  These functions have knowledge of
the MCA record and of how to call the routines in <CODE>drvSTR7201.c</CODE> 
They have no knowledge of the details of how the STR7201 works.
<P>
<CODE>drvSTR7201.c</CODE> is not a true EPICS driver, since it does not have a
driver entry table, or init() and report() functions.  However, it is a 
driver in the sense that it has no knowledge of the MCA record and its
functions could be 
called by device support from other records (e.g. waveform) if desired.  
<P>
The following lines must be added to <CODE>yourApp/src/Makefile.Vx</CODE>
<PRE>
LIBOBJS += drvSTR7201.o devSTR7201.o
SRCS.c += ../drvSTR7201.c ../devSTR7201.c
</PRE>

The following lines must be added to <CODE>yourApp/src/yourApp.dbd</CODE>
<PRE>
device(mca,VME_IO,devSTR7201,"Struck STR7201 MCS")
</PRE>
