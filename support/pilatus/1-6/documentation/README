--README file for Pilatus SoftIOC version 1.00 --22.12.06--



Prerequisites:

--	Edit the file "startup.script" first. Here the pc-name or ip-address has to be 	given, according to the integration of the DAQ PC into the network.
--	In the file "X06SA-PC-PILATUS_all.subs" one needs to specify the prefix. Here 	the default is PILATUS
	Use BL typical Prefix such as X06SA-ES-PIL
	Example:
		caput X06SA-ES-PIL:EXPTIME-READ

Most common used channels: 

##specify a file name or path and filename
FILENAME

##specify an exposure time
EXPTIME-SET

##read back which exposure time is active
EXPTIME-GET

##start taking an image (be sure that image name and exposure time are set before)
EXPOSURE-START

##stop an ongoing exposure (this does not work if Number of Images > 1)
EXPOSURE-STOP

##start taking an image. Difference to EXPOSURE-START: here you supply the
##filename along with the command like X06SA-ES-PIL:EXPOSURE-IMG test.tif
##!!exposure time has to be set first!!
EXPOSURE-IMG

##disconnect from camserver
DISCONNECT

##make a socket connection to the camera
CONNECT

##specify the number of images that should be taken with the given parameters.
##note: the image name will automatically be enumerated.
NIMAGE-SET

##read back the number of frames that is active
NIMAGE-GET

##specify an  ( |exptime|rdouttime|......| ) exposure period
##              |-----exposure period----| * nframes
EXPPER-SET

##read back the number of frames that is active
EXPPER-GET

##specity a number of exposures to be done within one frame
##very special command to date only Femto BL is interested in accumulating images
NEXPFRM-SET

##read back the number of frames that is active
NEXPFRM-GET

##specity a delay time: >>this is active in external mode only<<
##when using an external trigger signal delay defines when an exposure
##is started after a trigger was received.
DELAY-SET

##read back the number of frames that is active
DELAY-GET

##start exposure in  EXTERNAL TRIGGER MODE
##If a trigger arrives it performs exposures with the settings
##like Exposure Time, Exposure Period, Number of Frames, 
##Eposures Per Frame and Delay
##Exposure is started after a trigger is received.

EXT-TRIG-START

##alternative way to start an external triggered image mode.
##be sure to provide an image name when releasing this command
EXT-TRIG-IMG

##start exposure in  EXTERNAL ENABLE MODE
##If a trigger arrives it performs exposures with the settings
##like Exposure Period, Number of Frames, 
##Exposures Per Frame and Delay
##Exposure is started after a trigger is received (the gate length defines  
##the exposure time).
