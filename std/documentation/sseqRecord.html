<a NAME="Introduction"></a>
<h1>
1. Introduction</h1>

<hr>The <b>sseq</b> (String Sequence) record is derived from the <b>seq</b>
(Sequence) record, and has all of its capabilities. In addition, the <b>sseq</b>
record can read from either string or numeric fields, and write to either string
or numeric fields; it can wait for processing that any of its output links
triggers to complete; and its execution can be aborted. The record can execute a
sequence of up to ten sets of
<i>delay/get-value/put-value/wait-for-completion</i> operations.  All steps and
sequences are optional; with default field values, the record does nothing at
all.  Like the <b>seq</b> record, the <b>sseq</b> record implements several
selection algorithms that allow a database programmer, or run-time user, to
specify which sets of <i>delay/get/put/wait</i> to execute. The record has no
associated device support.

<P>The <b>sseq</b> record's execution can be aborted by the user.  When this
happens, the record will immediately stop causing other records to process, but
it cannot abort any execution it already started with one of its links.  Also,
aborting the <b>sseq</b> record will not prevent it from executing its forward
link.  

<P>Beginning with std-module version R3-0, the <i>string field</i> mentioned
above can be either a PV of type <tt>DBF_STRING</tt>, or an array PV whose
elements are of type <tt>DBF_CHAR</tt> or <tt>DBF_UCHAR</tt>.  In any case, the
length that will be read or written by the <b>sseq</b> record is limited to the
first 39 characters, because the sseq record uses EPICS string PVs internally.

<P>Beginning with std-module version R3-0, the <b>sseq</b> record posts the
states of its input and output links (but not its forward link), and posts
PVs that indicate which output links are waiting for callbacks.

<P>When writing to a PV of type <tt>DBF_MENU</tt> or <tt>DBF_ENUM</tt>, the
<b>sseq</b> record <i>always</i> writes its string value.  (Examples of such PVs
are any record's <tt>SCAN</tt> field, and the <tt>VAL</tt> field of a <b>bo</b>
or <b>mbbo</b> record.)  This is awkward, because it's common practice to write
numeric values to such fields, but doing so with the <b>sseq</b> record will not
have the expected result.  Worse, if there are no strings defined for such a PV,
then the <b>sseq</b> record simply cannot write to that PV.

<h1><a NAME="ScanFields"></a>
2. Scan/Control Fields</h1>


<hr>Like all other EPICS records, the sequence record has the standard set of
fields (<tt>SCAN</tt>, <tt>PINI</tt>, <tt>FLNK</tt>, <tt>PROC</tt>, etc.) for
specifying when or under what circumstances it should process, and what record,
if any, should process immediately afterward.  See the <i>EPICS Record Reference
Manual</i> for more information.

<P>In addition to standard control fields, the <b>sseq</b> record has
the field, <tt>ABORT</tt>:

<td>ABORT</td>

<td>SHORT</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>No</td>
</tr>

</table>

<P>The user, or another EPICS record, can cause a running <b>sseq</b> record to
stop executing links by writing '1' to the record's <tt>ABORT</tt> field.  The
<tt>ABORT</tt> field will remain '1' until the record has finished aborting, at
which time the field will be reset to '0'.  Only the execution of the record
itself will stop when it is aborted.  Any processing that the record has already
started (via its links) will be unaffected by the abort, and the forward link
will be executed in any case.

<P>The first write of '1' to the abort field waits for outstanding callbacks to
arrive before returning the record to the idle state.  This is the preferred way
to abort an executing sequence.  However, it may be that a callback the record is
waiting for will never arrive.  In this case, a more thorough abort is required,
to put the record back into an executable state.  Therefore, if a second write of
'1' to the abort field occurs while the record is waiting for callbacks, the
record will abandon outstanding callbacks, and return immediately to the idle
state. However, any abandoned callbacks remain outstanding, and can arrive at any
time. If one comes in while the record is idle, it will be ignored, but if it
comes in while the record is executing a fresh sequence, it may be treated as the
result of that fresh sequence.

<blockquote>It has become common practice for EPICS developers to treat a
sequence record's forward link as an extra <tt>LNK<i>n</i></tt> field, and to
chain a series of sequence records together using forward links.  These practices
are not recommended for use with the <b>sseq</b> record, because the forward link
is not subject to <tt>ABORT</tt>; it is <i>always</i> executed. </blockquote>

<blockquote>For previous versions of the record (earlier than std-module version
R3-0), users were cautioned not to write to the <tt>ABORT</tt> the record via a
<tt>PP</tt> link, because this could cause EPICS to reprocess the record after
the abort had succeeded.  The record now defends itself against this possibility,
by clearing its <tt>RPRO</tt> field as the last step of an abort. </blockquote> 

<p><a NAME="DesiredOutput"></a>
<h1>
3. Desired Output Fields</h1>

<hr>These link fields hold the values the record is to write to other records, or
determine from where those values are to be read.

<p>The sequence record can fetch up to 10 values from 10 locations. The user
specifies the locations in the Desired Output Link fields (<tt>DOL1-DOLA</tt>),
which can be either numeric constants or links to other EPICS PVs. If a Desired
Output Link is a numeric constant, the corresponding value field for that link is
initialized to the constant value. Otherwise, if the Desired Output Link is a
string, it is assumed to represent a link, a value is fetched from the link each
time the record is processed. See the <i>EPICS Record Reference Manual</i> for
information on how to specify database links.  If you want to initialize a string
value, use <tt>STR<i>n</i></tt>.  For example, to write a database file that
initializes the string <tt>STR1</tt> (the string that will be written by
<tt>LNK1</tt>) to <tt>"abcdefg"</tt>, include the bold line below:


<pre>
	record(sseq,"mySeqRecord") {
		...
		<b>field("STR1","abcdef")</b>
		...
	}
</pre>

<p>The values fetched from the Desired Output Links are stored in the
corresponding Desired Output fields (<tt>DO1-DOA</tt> and <tt>STR1-STRA</tt>).
These fields can be initialized by a database configuration tool, and they can be
changed at run time.  But note that the value of <tt>DO<i>n</i></tt> and
<tt>STR<i>n</i></tt> will be overwritten if <tt>DOL<i>n</i></tt> is a valid link
(i.e., if <tt>DOL<i>n</i></tt> contains the name of a PV to which the <b>sseq</b>
record is able to make a channel-access connection).

<P>Many EPICS records that have a <tt>DOL</tt> link field also have an
<tt>OMSL</tt> (Output Mode Select) field, which determines whether or not the
<tt>DOL</tt> field is used.  Like the <b>seq</b> record, the <b>sseq</b> record
has no such field.  Its <tt>DOL<i>n</i></tt> fields are treated as links if they
contain text that could be a PV name, and value fields are overwritten if those
links successfully retrieve values.

<h1>
4. Output/Wait Fields</h1>

<hr>When the <b>sseq</b> record is processed, desired output values
(<tt>DO<i>n</i></tt> or <tt>STR<i>n</i></tt>) are written to the corresponding
output links (<tt>LNK<i>n</i></tt>). These output links should either be blank
(in which case no writing will occur), or contain the name of an EPICS PV; they
may not be device addresses. There are ten output links. Only those that contain
valid PV names are used.  If a link field contains a PV name to which a CA
connection cannot be made, the rest of the record currently continues to operate
as though the unconnected link field were blank.  (This is probably not a good
practice, and it is not guaranteed to persist as the record is improved.)

<P>EPICS links can cause processing of the linked-to (i.e., target)
record to occur.  Whether or not processing actually does occur depends on both
the specification of the link, and the properties of the target record.  This is
well documented in the <i>EPICS Application Developer's Guide</i>, but since
some details of link behavior are essential prerequisites for an understanding
of the <b>sseq</b> record's <tt>WAIT<i>n</i></tt> fields, the (EPICS 3.14)
behavior of the output links, <tt>LNK<i>n</i></tt>, is summarized here:

<P> There are three possibilities:

<DL>

<DT>PP<DD>If <tt>LNK<i>n</i></tt> has the attribute <tt>PP</tt> (e.g.,
"<code>targetRecord.field PP NMS</code>"), then the link will attempt to cause
<code>targetRecord</code> to process.  The attempt will succeed, however, only if
the target record is "Passive" (e.g., <code>targetRecord.SCAN</code> has the
value <code>Passive</code>).  In other words, <tt>PP</tt> means "process if
passive".

<DT>CA<DD>If <tt>LNK<i>n</i></tt> has the attribute <tt>CA</tt> (e.g.,
"<code>targetRecord.field CA NMS</code>"), then <code>targetRecord</code> will
process only if <code>field</code> has been designated by
<code>targetRecord</code>'s record-support code as a "Process Passive" field. 
You can tell if a field is "Process Passive" either by looking at the record's
.dbd file, or by writing to it from any Channel Access client; if the record
processes when the field in question is written to via Channel Access, then the
field is Process Passive, and a <tt>CA</tt> link to that field from the <b>sseq</b> record
will also cause the record to process.

<DT>NPP<DD>If <tt>LNK<i>n</i></tt> has the attribute <tt>NPP</tt>, then
<code>targetRecord</code> will not process as a result of <tt>LNK<i>n</i></tt>.

</dl>

<P>The <b>sseq</b> record is permitted to demand a completion callback from
EPICS only if the output-link field it's processing has the attribute
<tt>CA</tt>.  A <tt>PP</tt> link is not permitted to make this demand.  If
<tt>LNK<i>n</i></tt> does have the <tt>CA</tt> attribute, and
<tt>WAIT<i>n</i></tt> has the value <tt>Wait</tt>, then the <b>sseq</b> record
will demand a completion callback.  In this case, it will wait after firing
<tt>LNK<i>n</i></tt> for the callback, before moving on to the next group of
<tt>DLY</tt>/<tt>DOL</tt>/<tt>LNK</tt> fields.  If <tt>LNK<i>n</i></tt> has any
attribute other than 'CA', <tt>WAIT<i>n</i></tt> is irrelevant and its value
will be ignored.

<P>If <tt>LNK<i>n</i></tt> has the attribute <tt>CA</tt>, and
<tt>WAIT<i>n</i></tt> has the value <tt>Wait</tt>, but
<code>targetRecord.field</code> is <i>not</i> a Process-Passive field, then
<code>targetRecord</code>  will not process as a result of <tt>LNK<i>n</i></tt>,
but the <b>sseq</b> record will immediately receive a completion callback anyway,
and will therefore not wait for <code>targetRecord</code> to process.

<P>Finally, if the <b>sseq</b> record successfully waits for
<code>targetRecord</code> to finish processing, it is still possible for other
records to process as an <i>indirect</i> result of <tt>LNK<i>n</i></tt>, and the
<b>sseq</b> record cannot wait for this indirectly caused processing to finish
unless the database developer has arranged for the indirectly caused processing
to be traceable by EPICS.  For example, a channel access client may have a
monitor on the field the <b>sseq</b> record writes to, and may do something when
that field's value changes.  EPICS cannot trace this processing without special
help from a database developer.  This issue is covered in depth in the
documentation of the <b>sscan</b> record, which also relies on EPICS execution
tracing to determine when processing it has caused finishes.  (See "Completion
Reporting" in the Powerpoint presentation "Scans.ppt" in the synApps <b>sscan</b>
module's documentation directory.)

<tr><td colspan=9>These fields determine whether the <b>sseq</b> record waits
for completion of processing started by an output link, and at what point in the
sequence the record waits.  If <tt>WAIT<i>n</i></tt> has any value other than
"NoWait", the record will wait.  To accomplish this, the record will attempt to
execute <tt>LNK<i>n</i></tt> in such a way that the record will be notified when
all processing started by the link has finished.  This attempt can succeed only
if the link has the attribute "CA".

<P>If <tt>WAIT<i>n</i></tt> has the value "Wait", the record will wait for
completion before going on to the next action.

<P>If <tt>WAIT<i>n</i></tt> has the value "After<i>i</i>, where <i>i</i> is in
[1,10], then the record will process actions up to and including action <i>i</i>
before waiting for completion.

<P>Thus, for example, if you want to execute links 1 and 2 in quick succession,
and then wait for completion of processing started by both links, before moving
on to link 3, you would set <tt>WAIT1</tt> to "After2", and set <tt>WAIT2</tt>
to either "Wait" or "After2".  (For link <i>n</i>, "Wait" means the same thing
as "After<i>n</i>").

<P>The sseq record cannot go back in time.  If you specify "After2" for link 3,
the record will behave as though you had specified "Wait" or (equivalently) 
"After3".

<tr><td colspan=9>These fields display the waiting states of their respective

</table>

<P>To avoid any misunderstanding, let me emphasize that <tt>WAIT<i>n</i></tt>
fields do not control or affect the <b>sseq</b> record's use of its delay
(<tt>DLY<i>n</i></tt>) fields.  <tt>WAIT<i>n</i></tt> only controls whether the
record will wait for processing started by <tt>LNK<i>n</i></tt> to complete.
Thus, if <tt>WAIT<i>n</i></tt> is 0, the record will execute
<tt>LNK<i>n</i></tt> and immediately pause for <tt>DLY<i>n</i></tt> seconds; if
<tt>WAIT<i>n</i></tt> is 1, the record will execute <tt>LNK<i>n</i></tt>, wait for processing
started by <tt>LNK<i>n</i></tt> to complete, and <i>then</i> pause for
<tt>DLY<i>n</i></tt> seconds.


<P>By the way, because the <b>sseq</b> record can write strings, it can be used
to write to link fields (its own, or those of another record).  This use can
succeed only if the link field doing the writing has the attribute <tt>CA</tt>.

<p><a NAME="Selection"></a>
<h1>
5. Selection Algorithm Fields</h1>

<hr>When the <b>sseq</b> record is processed, it uses a selection algorithm similar to
that of the sel (selection) record to decide which links to process.  The select
mechanism field (<tt>SELM</tt>) provides three algorithms to choose from: <tt>All</tt>,
<tt>Specified</tt> or <tt>Mask</tt>.

<DL>

<DT><tt>All</tt><DD>All link groups are processed, in order from 1 to 10. Thus,
if <tt>DOL1</tt> or <tt>LNK1</tt> is connected, record will wait for
<tt>DLY1</tt> seconds, fetch the desired output value from <tt>DOL1</tt> (if
<tt>DOL1</tt> contains a PV name), place it in DO1 and <tt>STR1</tt>, and send it
<tt>LNK1</tt> (if <tt>LNK1</tt> contains a PV name), optionally waiting for
completion.  Then the record will move on to process <tt>DLY2</tt>,
<tt>DOL2</tt>, <tt>DO2</tt>, <tt>STR2</tt>, <tt>LNK2</tt>, <tt>WAIT2</tt>, and so
on until the last input and output link <tt>DOA</tt> and <tt>LNKA</tt>.  The
<tt>SELN</tt> field is not used when <tt>SELM</tt> = <tt>All</tt>.

<DT><tt>Specified</tt><DD>Each time the
record is processed it will get the integer value in the Link Selection (<tt>SELN</tt>)
field and uses that as the index of the link group to process. For instance,
if <tt>SELN</tt> is 4, the desired output value from <tt>DO4</tt> will be fetched and sent
to <tt>LNK4</tt>. If <tt>DOL<i>n</i></tt> is a constant, <tt>DO<i>n</i></tt> is simply used without
the value being fetched from the input link.

<DT><tt>Mask</tt><DD>Each time the record is processed, the record uses the
integer value from the <tt>SELN</tt> field as a bit mask to determine which link
groups to process. For example, if <tt>SELN</tt> is 1, then the value from
<tt>DO1</tt> will be written to the location in <tt>LNK1</tt>. If <tt>SELN</tt>
is 3, the record will fetch the values from <tt>DO1</tt> and <tt>DO2</tt> and
write them to the locations in <tt>LNK1</tt> and <tt>LNK2</tt>, respectively. If
<tt>SELN</tt> is 63, <tt>DO1</tt>...<tt>DO6</tt> will be written to
<tt>LNK1</tt>...<tt>LNK6</tt>.

<p><a NAME="Delay"></a>
<h1>
6. Delay Fields</h1>

<hr>There are ten delay-related fields, one for each I/O link discussed
above. These fields cause the record to delay processing before fetching data
from the associated input link, or writing to the associated output link. For
example, if the user gives the <tt>DLY1</tt> field a value of 3.0, each time the record
is processed at run-time, the record will delay processing for three seconds
before fetching data from the <tt>DOL1</tt> link.  If neither an input or an output link
exist, the associated delay will be ignored.

<P>Delays are implemented with a time granularity of the system clock, which
typically has a frequency of 60 Hz.  When a delay value is specified, the record
rounds it to the nearest multiple of the system clock period, and writes it back
to the <tt>DLY<i>n</i></tt> field.

<hr>The only record support routine is process.
<br>
<br>
<dl>
<dd>
1. First, <tt>PACT</tt> is set to <tt>TRUE</tt>, and the link selection is fetched. Depending
on the selection mechanism, the link selection output links are processed
in order from <tt>LNK1</tt> to <tt>LNKA</tt>. When <tt>LNK<i>n</i></tt> is processed, the corresponding
<tt>DLY<i>n</i></tt> value is used to generate a delay via watchdog timer.</dd>

<dd>
2. After <tt>DLY<i>n</i></tt> seconds have expired, the input value is fetched from
<tt>DO<i>n</i></tt> (if <tt>DOL<i>n</i></tt> is constant) or <tt>DOL<i>n</i></tt> (if <tt>DOL<i>n</i></tt>
is a database link or channel access link) and written to <tt>LNK<i>n</i></tt>.</dd>

<dd> 3. When all links are completed, an asynchronous completion call back to
dbProcess is made (see the <i>EPICS Application Developer's Guide</i> for more
information on asynchronous processing.)</dd>

<dd>
4. Then <tt>UDF</tt> is set to <tt>FALSE</tt>.</dd>

<dd>
5. Monitors are checked.</dd>

<br>
<p>
<dd>
6. The forward link is scanned, <tt>PACT</tt> is set <tt>FALSE</tt>, and the process routine
returns.</dd>

<br> <p></dl> For the delay mechanism to operate properly, the record is
processed asynchronously. The only time the record will not be processed
asynchronously is when there are no non-NULL output links selected (i.e. when it
has nothing to do.) The processing of the links is done via callback tasks at the
priority set in the <tt>PRIO</tt> field in dbCommon (see the <i>EPICS Application
Developer's Guide</i> for more information.
