<h2 align="center">Release 1-2 (April 2, 2003)</h2>
<p align="left">Added full support for interrupts on the IP-Unidig-I models.&nbsp; For each input bit the hardware can be programmed to generate
interrupts on rising or falling transitions, or neither.&nbsp; The interrupt
service routine software is written to allow alternating which transition
generates interrupts, so that it is also possible to generate interrupts on both
rising and falling transitions.&nbsp; Wrote IpUnidig class so that other device
support can attach to interrupts on specific input lines and get callbacks
at interrupt level when a transition occurs.</p>
