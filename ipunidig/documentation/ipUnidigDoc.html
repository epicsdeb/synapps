    ipUnidig Driver</h1>
  <h1 style="text-align: center">
    Author: Mark Rivers</h1>
  <p>
    This package provides EPICS device support for the Greenspring IP-UD (formerly called
    the IP-Unidig) series of digital I/O Industry Pack modules. It also supports the
    Systran DIO316I and the SBS IP-OPTOIO-8. The IP-UD family includes more than 20
    separate models, though some are no longer available. This software provides support
    for most of these models. Most models provide 24 bits, with each bit individually
    programmable as an input or an output. The last section of this document describes
    any special features or restrictions on particular models.</p>
  <p>
    The driver is written in C++, and consists of a class that inherits from asynPortDriver,
    which is part of the EPICS asyn module. The driver supports 3 parameters, identified
    by the drvInfo strings used in the INP and OUT fields of records: DIGITAL_INPUT,
    DIGITAL_OUTPUT, and DAC_OUTPUT. DAC_OUTPUT is only supported on the IP-Unidig-HV
    series of modules.
  </p>
  <p>
    The driver supports interrupts on input transitions for modules that provide this
    capability, such as the IP-Unidig-I. Interrupts can be individually enabled and
    disabled for low-to-high and high-to-low transitions on each input bit. The interrupts
    can be used for I/O Intr scanning of bi and longin records. They can also be used
    to call other drivers when an interrupt occurs. This capability is used by the synApps
    quadEM module. The quadEM VME card cannot generate interrupts, but it can output
    a TTL pulse each time new data is available, at up to 815 Hz. If this pulse is input
    to the Ip-Unidig, the ipUnidig interrupt routine will call the quadEM driver each
    time new data is available.</p>
  <p>
    Most IP-Unidig modules are bi-directional, meaning each bit can be either an input
    or an output. This is done using open-collector output circuits, with pull-up resistors
    to +5V. If the output bit is set to 1 (High), then the open-collector transistor
    is turned off and the signal is pulled up to +5V. In that state an external device
    can drive the line to 0V or 5V. There is an independent input sensor that measures
    whether the line is above the TTL threshold (=High=1) or below the TTL threshold
    (=Low=0). Thus, setting the output 1 (High) effectively enables that line as an
    input. If the output is set to 0 (Low), its open collector will sink the current
    through the pull-up resistor and the line will go to 0V, and an external device
    cannot change the state.</p>
  <h2>
    Startup script</h2>
  <p>
    The following lines are needed in the EPICS startup script for the IP-Unidig.</p>
  <pre># Initialize Greenspring IP-Unidig
# initIpUnidig(char *portName, 
#              int carrier, 
#              int slot,
#              int msecPoll,
#              int intVec, 
#              int risingMask, 
#              int fallingMask)
# portName    = name to give this asyn port
# carrier     = IPAC carrier number (0, 1, etc.)
# slot        = IPAC slot (0,1,2,3, etc.)
# msecPoll    = polling time for input bits in msec.  Default=100.
# intVec      = interrupt vector
# risingMask  = mask of bits to generate interrupts on low to high (24 bits)
# fallingMask = mask of bits to generate interrupts on high to low (24 bits)

</pre>
  <p>
    Interrupts on the IP-Unidig-I models are fully supported. For each input bit the
    hardware can be programmed to generate interrupts on rising or falling transitions,
    or neither. The interrupt service routine software is written to allow alternating
    which transition generates interrupts, so that it is possible to generate interrupts
    on both rising and falling transitions.</p>
  <p>
    The risingMask and fallingMask parameters to initIpUnidig are used to specify which
    bits should generate interrupts on each edge. It is possible to have some bits set
    in neither mask, some in one mask and not the other, and some specified in both
    masks. For example if risingMask=0x5 (binary 101) and fallingMask=0x6 (binary 110),
    then the first input will generate interrupts on the rising edge, the second input
    will generate interrupts on the falling edge, the third input will generate interrupts
    on both rising and falling edges, and all other inputs will not generate interrupts
    at all.</p>
  <p>
    Generally risingMask and fallingMask will both be 0xFFFFFF, so that all bits generate
    interrupts on both transitions. However, if an input is changing very rapidly and
    one does not want interrupts on both or either transition, then that input in the
    mask should be 0. The msecPoll argument sets the time in milliseconds for polling
    the inputs. Polling is needed to periodically read inputs that do not generate interrupts
    on their transitions. An example <a href="ipUnidig.substitutions.html">ipUndig.subsitutions</a>
    file shows how to load the databases described below.</p>
  <h2>
    Databases</h2>
  <p>
    ipUnidig uses the standard asyn device support. 4 generic databases are provided:
    IpUnidigBi.db (binary output record), IpUnidigBo.db (binary output record), IpUnidigLi.db
    (longin record), IpUnidigLo.db (longout record). Database is provided for 3 records,
    binary output (bo), long input (longin) and binary input (bi). Each of these defines
    a single record. IpUnidigBi.db, for example contains:</p>
  <pre>record(bi,"$(P)$(R)") {
  field(PINI, "YES")
  field(DTYP,"asynUInt32Digital")
  field(INP,"@asynMask($(PORT) 0 $(MASK))DIGITAL_INPUT")
  field(SCAN, "$(SCAN)")
  field(ZNAM, "Low")
  field(ONAM, "High")
}
</pre>
  <p>
    In addition a remoteShutter.db file is provided for using the IP-Unidig with the
    APS remote shutter control.</p>

    IP-Unidig Models</h2>
  <p>
    The IP-Unidig family consists of more than 20 different models. These models differ
    in the following ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The input and output drivers can be TTL (IP-Unidig), differential (IP-Unidig-D),
      optically isolated (IP-Unidig-O), high-voltage (IP-Unidig-HV), or LineSafe (IP-Unidig-E).</li>
    <li>On some models the inputs are capable of generating interrupts. Models which can
      generate interrupts have a &quot;-I&quot; in the model name, e.g. IP-Unidig-I and
      IP-Unidig-I-HV. The interrupt capability of the modules is now fully supported in
      this software (it was not supported in releases prior to R1-2.). For each input
      bit the modules can be programmed to generate an interrupt on the rising edge, on
      the falling edge, on both edges, or never. If interrupts are not supported or desired,
      then the inputs on all models are polled (default rate = 10 Hz, any rate up to the
      60Hz system clock can be used), and &quot;pseudo-interrupts&quot; are generated
      by the input server if any input changes state.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The following provides information on specific models. Note that only the IP-Unidig-I
    and Systran DIO316I have actually been tested. The support for other models is based
    on reading the manuals. Users who have problems are encouraged to contact the author
    so that fixes can be incorporated.
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt>IP-Unidig, IP-Unidig-I</dt>
    <dd>
      The basic model (IP-Unidig) provides 24 bits of parallel I/O. Each bit can either
      be an input or an output. The outputs are open-collector. Writing a 1 to a bit turns
      off the open collector driver. In this state the on-board 1k pullup resistors will
      pull the line up to +5V, and an external device can pull the line low. Thus, writing
      a 1 to a bit allows that bit to be an input. At power-up all bits are set to 1,
      allowing them to be inputs.
    </dd>
    <dt></dt>
    <dt>IP-Unidig-E, IP-Unidig-I-E</dt>
    <dd>
      This is identical to the IP-Unidig except that the inputs have LineSafe protection.
    </dd>
    <dt></dt>
    <dt>IP-Unidig-E48</dt>
    <dd>
      This is identical to the IP-Unidig except that the inputs have LineSafe protection
      and there are 48 lines, rather than 24. This software currently only supports the
      first 24 bits when used with the IP-Unidig-E48.
    </dd>
    <dt></dt>
    <dt>IP-Unidig-D, IP-Unidig-I-D</dt>
    <dd>
      This is identical to the IP-Unidig except that the inputs and outputs use differential
      line drivers. The outputs are not open collector, and hence if a line is used as
      an output it cannot be used as an input. This software enables the output drivers
      dynamically. If a bit is set or cleared then that line is assumed to be an output,
      and its output driver is turned on. Once it is turned on it is never turned off.
      At powerup all output drivers are turned off, so all lines can be inputs.
    </dd>
    <dt></dt>
    <dt>IP-Unidig-HV, IP-Unidig-I-HV </dt>
    <dd>
      This is similar to the IP-Unidig except that the inputs and outputs are high-voltage
      capable. There are 2 options, -16I8O (16 inputs and 8 outputs) and -8I160 (8 inputs,
      16 outputs). Each high-voltage input is converted to a digital signal by the use
      of a voltage comparator. The reference for this comparator is an on-board 12 bit
      D/A converter, with a resolution of 15 mV/bit. At initialization the D/A is programmed
      for 2.5 volts. Device support can send messages with cmd = cmdSetDAC, and value=DAC
      value in the range 0 to 4095, corresponding to 0V to 61V threshold. On the 16I8O
      model the inputs are bits 0-15, and the outputs are bits 16-23. On the 8I16O model
      the inputs are bits 0-7, and the outputs are bits 8-23.
    </dd>
    <dt></dt>
    <dt>IP-Unidig-O, IP-Unidig-I-O </dt>
    <dd>
      This is similar to the IP-Unidig except that the inputs and outputs are optically
      isolated. There are 3 options, -24IO (24 inputs/outputs), 12I12O (12 inputs, 12
      outputs), -24I (24 inputs). On models with outputs the outputs are all enabled in
      the initialization code. On the 24IO model each line can be individually set to
      be an input by setting the output value to 1, just as with the basic IP-Unidig model.
      On the 12I12O model the inputs are bits 0-11 and the outputs are bits 12-23.
    </dd>
    <dt></dt>
    <dt>Other IP-Unidig models</dt>
    <dd>
      The IP-Unidig-T, IP-Unidig-T-D, IP-Unidig-P and IP-Unidig-P-D are not currently
      supported because they are quite different from the other IP-Unidig models
    </dd>
    <dt></dt>
    <dt>Systran DIO316I </dt>
    <dd>
      This is a digital I/O module which is similar to the IP-Unidig. This software support
      sets the module up as follows: - Ports 0-3 are output ports. This provides 32 bits
      of output. However, device support currently only supports the first 24 bits (ports
      0-2). - All output ports are enabled. - Ports 4 and 5 are input ports. This provides
      16 bits of input, bits 0-15.
