<h1>StreamDevice: Setup</h1>

<a name="pre"></a>
<h2>1. Prerequisites</h2>
<p>
<em>StreamDevice</em> requires either
<a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/base/R3-14/index.php"
target="ex">EPICS base R3.14.6 or higher</a> or
<a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/base/R3-13.php"
target="ex">EPICS base R3.13.7 or higher</a>.
How to use <em>StreamDevice</em> on EPICS R3.13 is described on a
<a href="epics3_13.html">separate page</a>.
</p>
<h3>Fix required for base R3.14.8.2 and earlier on Windows</h3>
<p>
Up to release R3.14.8.2, a fix in EPICS base is required to build
<em>StreamDevice</em> on Windows (not cygwin).
Add the following line to <kbd>src/iocsh/iocsh.h</kbd>
and rebuild base.
</p>
<pre>
epicsShareFunc int epicsShareAPI iocshCmd(const char *command);
</pre>

<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>
<em>StreamDevice</em> does not come with its own <kbd>&lt;top&gt;</kbd>
location and <kbd>&lt;top&gt;/configure</kbd> directory.
It expects to be put into an already existing <kbd>&lt;top&gt;</kbd>
directory structure.
You can simply create one with <code>makeBaseApp.pl</code>
(which is part of EPICS base):
</p>
<p>
<code>mkdir top</code><br>
<code>cd top</code><br>
<code>makeBaseApp.pl -t support</code>
</p>
<p>
When asked for "Application names" just hit Enter.
Then go to the newly created <kbd>configure</kbd> subdirectory and
edit the <kbd>RELEASE</kbd> file you find there according to the
instructions below.
</p>
<p>
After changing any configuration, you should run <code>make</code>
in this directory.
</p>
<p>
For details on <kbd>&lt;top&gt;</kbd> directories and <kbd>RELEASE</kbd>
files please refer to the
<a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/base/R3-14/8-docs/AppDevGuide.pdf"
target="ex"><em>IOC Application Developer's Guide</em></a> chapter 4:
EPICS Build Facility.
</p>

<h4>Support for <em>asynDriver</em></h4>
<p>
You most probably want <em>asynDriver</em> support included, because that is the
standard way for <em>StreamDevice</em> to talk to hardware.
First get and install <a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/modules/soft/asyn/"
target="ex"><em>asynDriver</em></a> version 4-3 or higher before you build <em>StreamDevice</em>.
I have tested <em>StreamDevice</em> with <em>asynDriver</em> versions up to 4-17.
Make sure that the <em>asyn</em> library can be found by adding the path to the
<em>&lt;top&gt;</em> directory of your <em>asyn</em> installation to the
<kbd>RELEASE</kbd> file:
<pre>
ASYN=/home/epics/asyn4-17
</pre>

<h4>Support for sCalcout record</h4>
<p>
The <a target="ex"
href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/bcda/synApps/calc/R2-8/sCalcoutRecord.html"
><em>sCalcout</em></a> record is part of <a target="ex"
href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/aod/bcda/synApps/index.php"
><em>synApps</em></a>.
If <em>streamDevice</em> should be built with support for this record,
you have to install the <em>calc</em> module from <em>SynApps</em> first.
Add references to the <kbd>RELEASE</kbd> file as shown here:
<pre>
CALC=/home/epics/synApps/calc-2-8
</pre>
<p>
Up to <em>calc</em> release R2-6 (<em>synApps</em> release R5_1),
the <em>sCalcout</em> record needs a fix.
(See separate <a href="scalcout.html"><em>scalcout</em> page</a>.)
And the <em>calc</em> modue had dependencies on other <em>SynApps</em>
modules. Release R2-8 or newer is recommended.
</p>
<p>
Support for the scalcout is optional. <em>StreamDevice</em> works
as well without scalcout or SynApps.
</p>

<h4>Support for regular expression matching</h4>
<p>
If you want to enable regular expression matching, you need the <em>PCRE</em> package.
For most Linux systems, it is already installed.
In that case add the locations you have to make the locations of the
<em>PCRE</em> header file and library known.
However, the pre-installed package can only by used for the host architecture.
Thus, add them not to <kbd>RELEASE</kbd> but to <kbd>RELEASE.Common.linux-x86</kbd>
(if linux-x86 is your EPICS_HOST_ARCH).
Note that different Linux distributions may locate the files in different directories.
</p>
<pre>
PCRE_INCLUDE=/usr/include/pcre
PCRE_LIB=/usr/lib
</pre>
<p>
A pre-compiled Windows version of <em>PCRE</em> is available at
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32/files/pcre/7.0/pcre-7.0.exe/download"
target="ex">sourceforge</a>
</p>
<p>
If you want to have <em>PCRE</em> support on platforms that don't support it natively,
e.g. vxWorks, it is probably the easiest to build <em>PCRE</em> as an EPICS application.
</p>
<p>
<h4>Building the <em>PCRE</em> package as an EPICS module</h4>
<p>
<ol>
<li>
Download the <em>PCRE</em> package from <a target=ex href="http://www.pcre.org">www.pcre.org</a>.
</li>
<li>
Extract the <em>PCRE</em> package in the <kbd>&lt;top&gt;</kbd> directory of
<em>StreamDevice</em> or create a separate <kbd>&lt;top&gt;</kbd> location using
<code>makeBaseApp.pl</code>.
</li>
<li>
Download this <a target=ex href="http://epics.web.psi.ch/software/streamdevice/pcre/Makefile"
>Makefile</a> and this
<a target=ex href="http://epics.web.psi.ch/software/streamdevice/pcre/fixforvxworks.pl"
>fixforvxworks.pl</a> script and save them to the extracted pcre directory.
</li>
<li>
Change into the pcre direcrory and run <code>perl fixforvxworks.pl</code>
</li>
<li>
Run <code>make</code> (or <code>gmake</code>)
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Define the location of the pcre <kbd>&lt;top&gt;</kbd> in the RELEASE file for <em>StreamDevice</em>.
</p>
<pre>
PCRE=/home/epics/pcre
</pre>
<p>
Regular expressions are optional. If you don't want them, you don't need this.
</p>

<a name="lib"></a>
<h2>2. Build the <em>StreamDevice</em> Library</h2>
<p>
Unpack the
<a href="http://epics.web.psi.ch/software/streamdevice/StreamDevice-2.tgz"
><em>StreamDevice</em> package</a> in the <kbd>&lt;top&gt;</kbd> directory
of your application build area.
(You might probably have done this already.)
Go to the newly created <em>StreamDevice</em> directory
and run <code>make</code> (or <code>gmake</code>).
This will create and install the <em>stream</em> library and the
<kbd>stream.dbd</kbd> file.
</p>
<a name="app"></a>
<h2>3. Build an Application</h2>
<p>
To use <em>StreamDevice</em>, your application must be built with the
<em>asyn</em> and <em>stream</em> libraries and must load
<kbd>asyn.dbd</kbd> and <kbd>stream.dbd</kbd>.
</p>
<p>
Include the following lines in your application Makefile:
</p>
<pre>
PROD_LIBS += stream
PROD_LIBS += asyn
</pre>
<p>
Include the following lines in your xxxAppInclude.dbd file to use
<em>stream</em> and <em>asyn</em> with serial lines, IP sockets,
and vxi11 ("GPIB over ethernet") support.
</p>
<pre>
include "base.dbd"
include "stream.dbd"
include "asyn.dbd"
registrar(drvAsynIPPortRegisterCommands)
registrar(drvAsynSerialPortRegisterCommands)
registrar(vxi11RegisterCommands)
</pre>
<p>
You can find an example application in the <kbd>streamApp</kbd>
subdirectory.
</p>

<a name="sta"></a>
<h2>4. The Startup Script</h2>
<p>
<em>StreamDevice</em> is based on <a
href="protocol.html"><em>protocol files</em></a>.
To tell <em>StreamDevice</em> where to search for protocol files,
set the environment variable <code>STREAM_PROTOCOL_PATH</code> to a
list of directories to search.
On Unix and vxWorks systems, directories are separated by <code>:</code>,
on Windows systems by <code>;</code>.
The default value is <code>STREAM_PROTOCOL_PATH=.</code>,
i.e. the current directory.
</p>
<p>
Also configure the buses (in <em>asynDriver</em> terms: ports) you want
to use with <em>StreamDevice</em>.
You can give the buses any name you want, like <kbd>COM1</kbd> or
<kbd>socket</kbd>, but I recommend to use names related to the
connected device.
</p>
<h3>Example:</h3>
<p>
A power supply with serial communication (9600 baud, 8N1) is connected to
<kbd>/dev/ttyS1</kbd>.
The name of the power supply is <tt>PS1</tt>.
Protocol files are either in the current working directory or in the
<kbd>../protocols</kbd> directory.
</p>
<p>
Then the startup script must contain lines like this:
</p>
<pre>
epicsEnvSet ("STREAM_PROTOCOL_PATH", ".:../protocols")

drvAsynSerialPortConfigure ("PS1","/dev/ttyS1")
asynSetOption ("PS1", 0, "baud", "9600")
asynSetOption ("PS1", 0, "bits", "8")
asynSetOption ("PS1", 0, "parity", "none")
asynSetOption ("PS1", 0, "stop", "1")
asynSetOption ("PS1", 0, "clocal", "Y")
asynSetOption ("PS1", 0, "crtscts", "N")
</pre>

<p>If the power supply was connected via telnet-style TCP/IP
at address 192.168.164.10 on port 23,
the startupscript would contain:
</p>
<pre>
epicsEnvSet ("STREAM_PROTOCOL_PATH", ".:../protocols")

drvAsynIPPortConfigure ("PS1", "192.168.164.10:23")
</pre>

<p>
With a VXI11 (GPIB via TCP/IP) connection, e.g. a
HP E2050A on IP address 192.168.164.10, it would look like this:
</p>
<pre>
epicsEnvSet ("STREAM_PROTOCOL_PATH", ".:../protocols")

vxi11Configure ("PS1","192.168.164.10",1,1000,"hpib")
</pre>


<a name="pro"></a>
<h2>5. The Protocol File</h2>
<p>
For each different type of hardware, create a protocol file
which defines protocols for all needed functions of the device.
The file name is arbitrary, but I recommend that it contains
the device type.
It must not contain spaces and should be short.
During <code>iocInit</code>, <em>streamDevice</em> loads and parses
the required protocol files.
If the files contain errors, they are printed on the IOC shell.
Put the protocol file in one of the directories listed in
<code>STREAM_PROTOCOL_PATH</code>.
</p>
<h3>Example:</h3>
<p>
<tt>PS1</tt> is an <em>ExamplePS</em> power supply.
It communicates via ASCII strings which are terminated by
&lt;carriage&nbsp;return&gt; &lt;line&nbsp;feed&gt; (ASCII codes 13, 10).
The output current can be set by sending a string like
<code>"CURRENT 5.13"</code>.
When asked with the string <code>"CURRENT?"</code>, the device returns
the last set value in a string like <code>"CURRENT 5.13 A"</code>.
</p>
<p>
Normally, an analog output record should write its value to the device.
But during startup, the record should be initialized from the the device.
The protocol file <kbd>ExamplePS.proto</kbd> defines the protocol
<code>setCurrent</code>.
</p>
<pre>
Terminator = CR LF;

setCurrent {
    out "CURRENT %.2f";
    @init {
        out "CURRENT?";
        in "CURRENT %f A";
    }
}
</pre>

<a name="reload"></a>
<h3>Reloading the Protocol File</h3>
<p>
During development, the protocol files might change frequently.
To prevent restarting the IOC all the time, it is possible to reload
the protocol file of one or all records with the shell function
<code>streamReload("<var>record</var>")</code>.
If <code>"<var>record</var>"</code> is not given, all records using
<em>StreamDevice</em> reload their protocols.
Furthermore, the <code>streamReloadSub</code> function can be used
with a subroutine record to reload all protocols.
</p>
<p>
Reloading the protocol file aborts currently running protocols.
This might set <code>SEVR=INVALID</code> and <code>STAT=UDF</code>.
If a record can't reload its protocol file (e.g. because of a syntax
error), it stays <code>INVALID</code>/<code>UDF</code> until a valid
protocol is loaded.
</p>

<p>
See the <a href="protocol.html">next chapter</a> for protocol files in depth.
</p>

<a name="rec"></a>
<h2>6. Configure the Records</h2>
<p>
To make a record use <em>StreamDevice</em>, set its <code>DTYP</code> field to
<code>"stream"</code>.
</p>
<p>
The <code>INP</code> or <code>OUT</code> link has the form
<code>"@<var>file&nbsp;protocol&nbsp;bus</var>&nbsp;[<var>address</var>&nbsp;[<var>parameters</var>]]"</code>.
</p>
<p>
Here, <code><var>file</var></code> is the name of the protocol file and
<code><var>protocol</var></code> is the name of a protocol defined in this file.
(See the <a href="protocol.html">next chapter</a>.)
</p>
<p>
If the protocol requires <a href="protocol.html#argvar">arguments</a>,
specify them enclosed in parentheses:
<code><var>protocol</var>(<var>arg1,arg2,...</var>)</code>.
</p>
<p>
The communication channel is specified with <code><var>bus</var></code>
(aka <em>asynDriver</em> "port") and <code><var>addr</var></code>.
If the bus does not have addresses, <code><var>addr</var></code> is dispensable.
Optional <code><var>parameters</var></code> are passed to the bus driver.
</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>
<p>
Create an output record to set the current of <tt>PS1</tt>.
Use protocol <em>setCurrent</em> from file <em>ExamplePS.proto</em>.
The bus is called <em>PS1</em> like the device.
</p>

<pre>
record (ao, "PS1:I-set")
{
    field (DESC, "Set current of PS1")
    <b>field (DTYP, "stream")</b>
    <b>field (OUT,  "@ExamplePS.proto setCurrent PS1")</b>
    field (EGU,  "A")
    field (PREC, "2")
    field (DRVL, "0")
    field (DRVH, "60")
    field (LOPR, "0")
    field (HOPR, "60")
}
</pre>
