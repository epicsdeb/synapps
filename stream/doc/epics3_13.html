<h1>StreamDevice: Using EPICS 3.13</h1>

<a name="pre"></a>
<h2>1. Prerequisites</h2>
<p>
<em>StreamDevice</em> version 2.2 and higher can run on EPICS 3.13.
However, this requires some preparation, because EPICS 3.13 is missing
some libraries and header files.
Also <em>asynDriver</em></a> needs to be modified to compile with EPICS 3.13.
Due to the limitations of EPICS 3.13, you can build streamDevice only for
vxWorks systems.
</p>
<p>
Of course, you need an installation of <a target="ex"
href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/base/R3-13.php">EPICS 3.13</a>.
I guess you already have that, otherwhise you would want to
<a href="setup">install <em>StreamDevice</em> on EPICS 3.14</a>.
I have tested <em>StreamDevice</em> with EPICS versions 3.13.7 up to 3.13.10
with vxWorks 5.3.1 and 5.5 on a ppc604 processor.
</p>
<p>
Download my <a
href="http://epics.web.psi.ch/software/streamdevice/compat-1-0.tgz">
compatibility package</a>,
<a target="ex"
href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/modules/soft/asyn/"><em>asynDriver</em></a>
version 4-3 or higher,
and my <a
href="http://epics.web.psi.ch/software/streamdevice/configure.tgz">
configure patches</a>.
</p>

<a name="compat"></a>
<h2>2. Build the Compatibility Package</h2>
<p>
Unpack <kbd>compat-1-0.tgz</kbd> in the <kbd>&lt;top&gt;</kbd> directory of
your application build area.
(Please refer to the <a target="ex"
href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/EpicsDocumentation/AppDevManuals/iocScm-3.13.2/managingATop.html#3">
<em>EPICS IOC Software Configuration Management</em></a> document.)
</p>
<p>
Change to the <kbd>compat</kbd> directory and run <kbd>make</kbd>.
This installs many EPICS 3.14-style header files and a small library
(<kbd>compatLib</kbd>).
</p>

<a name="asyn"></a>
<h2>3. Build the <em>asynDriver</em> Library</h2>
<p>
Unpack the <em>asynDriver</em> package and change to its top directory.
</p>
<p>
Unpack <kbd>configure.tgz</kbd> here.
This will modify files in the <kbd>configure</kbd> directory.
Change to the <kbd>configure</kbd> directory and edit <kbd>CONFIG_APP</kbd>.
Set <code>COMPAT=...</code> to the <kbd>&lt;top&gt;</kbd>
directory where you have installed the compatibility package before.
(This patch might also allow you to compile other 3.14-style drivers for 3.13.
It has absolutely no effect if you use EPICS 3.14.)
</p>
<p>
Edit <kbd>RELEASE</kbd> and comment out <code>IPAC=...</code>
(unless you have the <em>ipac</em> package and somehow made it
compatible to EPICS 3.13).
Set <code>EPICS_BASE</code> to your EPICS 3.13 installation.
</p>
<p>
Run <kbd>make</kbd> in the <kbd>configure</kbd> directory.
</p>
<p>
Change to <kbd>../asyn/devGpib</kbd> and edit
<kbd>devGpib.h</kbd> and <kbd>devSupportGpib.c</kbd>.
Change all occurrences of <code>static&nbsp;gDset</code> to
<code>gDset</code>.
</p>
<p>
Go one directory up (to <kbd>asyn</kbd>) and run <kbd>make</kbd> twice!
(The first run will just create <kbd>Makefile.Vx</kbd>.)
Ignore all compiler warnings.
</p>
<p>
Do not try to build the test applications. It will not work.
</p>

<a name="lib"></a>
<h2>4. Build the <em>StreamDevice</em> Library</h2>
<p>
Go to the <kbd>&lt;top&gt;</kbd> directory of your application build area.
</p>
<p>
Edit <kbd>config/RELEASE</kbd> and add the variable <code>ASYN</code>.
Set it to the location of the <em>asynDriver</em> installation.
Also set the <code>COMPAT</code> variable to the location of the
compatibility package.
Run <kbd>make</kbd> in the <kbd>config</kbd> directory.
<p>
Unpack the <em>StreamDevice</em> package in your <kbd>&lt;top&gt;</kbd>
directory.
Change to the newly created <em>StreamDevice</em> directory
and run <kbd>make</kbd>.
</p>

<a name="app"></a>
<h2>5. Build an Application</h2>
<p>
To use <em>StreamDevice</em>, your application must be built with the
<em>asyn</em>, <em>stream</em>, and <em>compat</em> libraries and must load
<kbd>asyn.dbd</kbd> and <kbd>stream.dbd</kbd>.
Also, as the <em>stream</em> library contains C++ code, the application
must be munched.
Therefore, include <kbd>$(TOP)/config/RULES.munch</kbd>.
(Put your application in the same <kbd>&lt;top&gt;</kbd> as the
<em>StreamDevice</em> installation.)
</p>
<p>
Include the following lines in your <kbd>Makefile.Vx</kbd>:
</p>
<pre>
LDLIBS += $(COMPAT_BIN)/compatLib
LDLIBS += $(ASYN_BIN)/asynLib
LDLIBS += $(INSTALL_BIN)/streamLib

include $(TOP)/config/RULES.munch
</pre>
<p>
Include the following lines in your <kbd>xxxAppInclude.dbd</kbd> file to use
<em>stream</em> and <em>asyn</em> (you also need a <kbd>base.dbd</kbd>):
</p>
<pre>
include "base.dbd"
include "stream.dbd"
include "asyn.dbd"
</pre>
<p>
You can find an example application in the <kbd>streamApp</kbd>
subdirectory.
</p>

<a name="sta"></a>
<h2>6. The Startup Script</h2>
<p>
<em>StreamDevice</em> is based on <a
href="protocol.html"><em>protocol files</em></a>.
To tell <em>StreamDevice</em> where to search for protocol files,
set the environment variable <code>STREAM_PROTOCOL_PATH</code> to a
list of directories to search.
Directories are separated by <code>:</code>.
The default value is <code>STREAM_PROTOCOL_PATH=.</code>,
i.e. the current directory.
</p>
<p>
Also configure the buses (in <em>asynDriver</em> terms: ports) you want
to use with <em>StreamDevice</em>.
You can give the buses any name you want, like <kbd>COM1</kbd> or 
<kbd>socket</kbd>, but I recommend to use names related to the
connected device.
</p>
<h3>Example:</h3>
<p>
A power supply with serial communication (9600 baud, 8N1) is connected to
<kbd>/dev/ttyS1</kbd>.
The name of the power supply is <tt>PS1</tt>.
Protocol files are either in the current working directory or in the
<kbd>../protocols</kbd> directory.
</p>
<p>
Then the startup script must contain lines like this:
</p>
<pre>
ld < iocCore
ld < streamApp.munch
dbLoadDatabase ("streamApp.dbd")

putenv ("STREAM_PROTOCOL_PATH=.:../protocols")

drvAsynSerialPortConfigure ("PS1","/dev/ttyS1")
asynSetOption ("PS1", 0, "baud", "9600")
asynSetOption ("PS1", 0, "bits", "8")
asynSetOption ("PS1", 0, "parity", "none")
asynSetOption ("PS1", 0, "stop", "1")
</pre>

<p>
An alternative approach is to skip step 5 (do not build an application)
and load all components explicitely in the startup script.
The <code>STREAM_PROTOCOL_PATH</code> variable can also be a vxWorks shell
variable.
</p>
<pre>
ld < iocCore
ld < compatLib
ld < asynLib
ld < streamLib.munch
dbLoadDatabase ("asyn.dbd")
dbLoadDatabase ("stream.dbd")

STREAM_PROTOCOL_PATH=".:../protocols"

drvAsynSerialPortConfigure ("PS1","/dev/ttyS1")
asynSetOption ("PS1", 0, "baud", "9600")
asynSetOption ("PS1", 0, "bits", "8")
asynSetOption ("PS1", 0, "parity", "none")
asynSetOption ("PS1", 0, "stop", "1")
</pre>
