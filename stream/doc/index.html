<h1>EPICS <em>StreamDevice</em></h1>

<h2>What is <em>StreamDevice</em>?</h2>
<p>
<em>StreamDevice</em> is a generic
<a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics" target="ex">EPICS</a>
device support for devices with a "byte stream" based
communication interface.
That means devices that can be controlled by sending and
receiving strings (in the broadest sense, including non-printable
characters and even null-bytes). 
Examples for this type of communication interface are
serial line (RS-232, RS-485, ...),
IEEE-488 (also known as GPIB or HP-IB), and telnet-like TCP/IP.
</p>
<p>
<em>StreamDevice</em> is not limited to a specific device type or
manufacturer nor is it necessary to re-compile anything to support a
new device type.
Instead, it can be configured for any device type with
<a href="protocol.html"><em>protocol files</em></a> in plain ASCII text
which describes the commands a device understands and the replies it sends.
If the device can be controlled with strings like
"<kbd>RF:FREQ 499.655 MHZ</kbd>" <em>StreamDevice</em> can be used.
Formatting and parsing of values is done with
<a href="formats.html"><em>format converters</em></a> similar to those
known from the C functions <em>printf()</em> and <em>scanf()</em>.
To support other formats, it is possible to
<a href="formatconverter.html">write your own converters</a>.
</p>
<p>
Each record with <em>StreamDevice</em> support runs one protocol
from the protocol file to read or write its value.
Protocols can be as simple as just one output string or can
consist of many strings sent to and read from the device.
However, a protocol is linear.
That means it runs from start to end each time the record is
<a href="processing.html">processed</a>.
It does not provide loops or branches.
</p>
<p>
<em>StreamDevice</em> comes with an interface to<a target="ex"
href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/modules/soft/asyn/">
<em>asynDriver</em></a>
but can be extended to
<a href="businterface.html">support other bus drivers</a>.
Note that <em>StreamDevice</em> is not an alternative or replacement
but a supplement for <em>asynDriver</em>.
<em>StreamDevice</em> converts record values to and from strings but
leaves it to <em>asynDriver</em> (or other bus interfaces) to exchange
these strings with the device.
Thus any bus type supported by <em>asynDriver</em> (to be exact by
<em>asynOctet</em>) can automatically be used with <em>StreamDevice</em>.
</p>
<p>
<em>StreamDevice</em> supports all
<a href="recordtypes.html">standard records</a> of EPICS base
which can have device support.
It is also possible to
<a href="recordinterface.html">write support for new record types</a>.
</p>

<h2>What is <em>StreamDevice</em> not?</h2>
<p>
It is not a programming language for a high-level application.
It is, for example, not possible to write a complete scanning program
in a protocol.
Use other tools for that and use <em>StreamDevice</em> only for the
primitive commands.
</p>
<p>
It is not a block oriented device support.
It is not possible to send or receive huge blocks of data that contain
many process variables distributed over many records.
