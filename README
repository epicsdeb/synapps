Note that the build location has changed from previous versions of synApps.
Now, you run make in support, and it references configure/RELEASE.
The directory, config, no longer exists.

==============================================================================
        SITE CONFIGURATION
==============================================================================
Edit the following for your site:

configure/CONFIG_SITE

        - Set the values of variables to indicate what resources your system
        has.  The synApps build has a limited ability to adjust itself to
        accommodate different system configurations.
        

configure/RELEASE
configure/RELEASE.win32-x86 (for win32-x86 only)

        - Specify paths to EPICS base and to modules. After modifying this file,
        run "make release" in support to propagate changes to all module RELEASE
        files.  (For win32-x86, run "make -f Makefile.win32-x86 release".)

Makefile
Makefile.win32-x86 (for win32-x86 only)
        - Select modules to build.
        Add/delete support modules by adding/deleting
        '#' to the two entries for each support module;  
                SUPPORT_DIRS += $(module)
                RELEASE_FILES += $(module)/configure/RELEASE

To build synApps:
        set EPICS_HOST_ARCH appropriately (e.g., solaris-sparc)
        make release
        make

NOTE that 'make' implies GNU make throughout this file.

To rebuild synApps:
        set EPICS_HOST_ARCH appropriately
        make release
        make clean uninstall
        make

"make release" ensures that all the modules have consistent paths in
their RELEASE files.


==============================================================================
After adding a module
1) edit support/configure/RELEASE
2) edit support/Makefile
3) run "make release" in support
4) run "make rebuild" in any module that uses the new module
