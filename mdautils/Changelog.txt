MDA Utilities Version Changelog


From 1.2.2 to 1.3.0

mda-load library: 
    Added another check for corrupted files.

mda2ascii:
    Refactored the code behind -f option to be more efficient.

mdatree2ascii
    Added new script utility for converting entire directory trees of
    files into new corresponding trees containing the output.


From 1.2.1 to 1.2.2

mda-load library: 
    Fixed a bug that would cause an MDA file to not load if there was
    an Extra PV that was of the char type.  Also added preprocessor
    commands to mda-load.h in order to make the library C++ compatible
    (Michael Hu).


From 1.2 to 1.2.1

mda2ascii:
    There was a bug when using the -f flag, which can cause a
    positioner column to show a printf format instead of the data
    (it's fairly obvious when this does happen). This only occurred
    when the all the values for a positioner were integers.
mda-ls, mda-info, and mda2ascii: 
    Many instances of repetitive deep pointer dereferencing were
    removed from the code. It makes the code slightly faster, and also
    easier to understand.
Makefile: 
    Added DESTDIR variable for making distribution packages simpler
    (J. Lewis Muir).
Documentation: 
    Added Changelog.txt file.  Fixed typos in various files (some from
    J. Lewis Muir).


From 1.1 to 1.2

mda-load library: 
    Changed from generic int types to fixed length int types, as it is
    more portable in the long term, and fixes problems with MacOS
    compiling.  Look for occasional over-allocations of memory for
    strings (which tend to be severe, but don't cause failures) and
    then reduce memory consumption.  Remove warning when building on
    MacOS (J. Lewis Muir).
mda-dump: 
    Fixed the behavior of not releasing memory allocated for strings;
    this is not a critical issue, it just lets the program run with an
    even smaller memory footprint.
Makefile:
    Fixed the install option, especially regarding documentation
    (J. Lewis Muir).  Added detection of MacOS X to work around
    missing xdr function.


From 1.0 to 1.1

mda2ascii: 
    Added option to print out all existing scans in a file, even if
    they are incomplete due to an abort of the scan, and marks them.
mda-dump: 
    Shows the offset of scans as they are read, as well as the offset
    of extra PV information.
mda-info: 
    Shows the saveData numbering in parentheses for detectors,
    positioners, and triggers.
mda-load library:
    Added check for a certain type of corrupt MDA file, leading to
    fewer crashes of the utilities.
Makefile: 
    Added install option.


From 0.3 to 1.0:

mda2ascii: 
    New options created, such as create scan files for scan dimensions
    higher than 1, output a friendlier representation of the data (at
    the expense of a larger file), and put extra PV information in a
    separate file.
mda-dump: 
    Rewritten to display data immediately as it is read to help track
    file errors.
mda-info: 
    Now shows all the information on positioners, detectors, and
    triggers.
mda-ls: 
    New utility that gives a brief description of the scans contained
    in MDA files in a directory.
mda-load library: 
    Memory leaks fixed, functions added for loading parts of an MDA
    file as needed.
