.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mda-info
.RB [ \-hv ]
.I "file"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mda-info
is a utility for seeing certain information about MDA files, which are
created by
.BR saveData \ in
.BR EPICS .
Things such as scan time, dimensionality, positioners, detectors, and
triggers are shown.  For each trigger, positioner, and detector there
is both a number and, located in parentheses, the PV field number used
in saveData.  Unless one of the options is used,
.B mda-info 
needs only
.IR "file" ,
the name of the MDA file.  If a file is irregular, it is stated as
such and the actual overall scan size is shown, taken from the individual
scans themselves.
.PP
This program does not load the entire file, so it's fast.
