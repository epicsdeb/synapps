To build any examples;

- in <motor>/configure/RELEASE: EPICS_BASE and MOTOR must be defined.

- in <motor>/Makefile: the following three lines must be uncommented;
  #!DIRS += motorExApp iocBoot
  #!motorExApp_DEPEND_DIRS = motorApp
  #!iocBoot_DEPEND_DIRS    = motorExApp

To build this simulation example;

- in <motor>/configure/RELEASE: ASYN must be defined.

- in <motor>/iocBoot/iocSim/Makefile set the target architecture
          
Finally, cd <motor>; gnumake clean uninstall; gnumake

To run this simulation example on a Unix OS;
- Set the EPICS_HOST_ARCH environment variable correctly.
- Edit the st.cmd.unix file for either sun or linux.
- Start the ioc from this directory by executing the following command.

../../bin/${EPICS_HOST_ARCH}/WithAsyn st.cmd.unix
