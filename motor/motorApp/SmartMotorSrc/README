The Animatics SmartMotor EPICS device driver supports both single and daisy
chained serial connections.

For RS232 daisy chained applications, the following program must be down loaded
to each motor in the chain. Set "#" below to the address of each consecutive
motor; starting with 1.

SADDR#
ECHO
LIMD <- Omit from firmware 4.77 and above.
LIMH
END

For RS232 or RS485 non-daisy-chained applications, the EPICS device driver
requires that echo mode be turned off (ECHO_OFF).

From the Animatics "SmartMotor User's Guide";
"A single RS-232 SmartMotor can operate in either state, but a daisy chain of
RS-232 SmartMotors must operate in ECHO mode for data to get through the
network.  RS-485 SmartMotors must operate in the ECHO_OFF mode or there will be
data collisions."

Device Driver Design Restriction and Limitations
================================================

- This device driver only supports SmartMotor firmware versions 4.15
  and above.

- A network of RS-485 SmartMotor's is not supported by this device driver.

- Non-daisy-chained SmartMotor's (i.e., a serial port for each SmartMotor) must
  have their echo mode turned off (ECHO_OFF).
