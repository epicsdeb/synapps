    Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The CAMAC record is designed to perform generic CAMAC I/O. The CAMAC Branch (B),
    Crate (C), Slot (N), Subaddress (A), Function code (F) and transfer mode are all
    controlled by record fields which can be modified at run time. Applications for
    this record include accessing CAMAC modules for which no device support exists,
    and for performing CAMAC diagnostics.
  </p>
  <p>
    The CAMAC record is intended only for this specialized CAMAC I/O function. The CAMAC
    record directly calls the ESONE compatible CAMAC library, without an intermediate
    device support layer.
  </p>
  <p>
    The CAMAC record supports array operations, i.e. CAMAC block transfer operations.
    The VAL field contains the data to be written or the data read. Depending upon the
    CAMAC hardware being used this may use DMA from the CAMAC controller to the VME
    bus memory.
  </p>
  <p>
    This record requires the use of an underlying ESONE compatible CAMAC library. A
    library which supports serial highway drivers and the Kinetic Systems 2917/3922
    parallel bus crate controller is part of the camac module.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a CAMAC operation returns Q=0 it will be reflected in the Q field of the record,
    but will not raise an alarm. X=0 will raise a minor alarm. Any other errors detected
    in the CAMAC library will raise a major alarm.

    The following IDL program demonstrates the use of the Generic CAMAC record. It does
    a block-mode read of a scaler in slot 14 and plots the results. It also demonstrates
    using the "Crate Command" (CCMD) field to clear the Inhibit line.

  <pre>; This IDL program demonstrates the use of the 
; Generic CAMAC record. 
; It does a Q-repeat read of a scaler in slot 14 
; and plots the results.

; The name of the generic CAMAC record
rec = 'test_camac1'

; Set up B, C, N, A for scaler 0 (first scaler)
;   in slot 14 on crate 0, branch 0.
t = caput(rec+'.B', 0)
t = caput(rec+'.C', 0)
t = caput(rec+'.N', 14)
t = caput(rec+'.A', 0)

; Make sure the crate Inhibit line is clear, 
;   because it would stop the scaler
t = caput(rec+'.CCMD', &quot;Clear Inhibit&quot;)

; Set the transfer mode to Q-repeat
t = caput(rec+'.TMOD', &quot;Q Repeat&quot;)

; Set up to read the scaler 1024 times
t = caput(rec+'.NUSE', 1024)

; Read the scaler into the record VAL field
