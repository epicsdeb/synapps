    <h2>
      Release 2-7</h2>
    <h2>
      August 19, 2014</h2>
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>Added support for function code 23, Read/Write Multiple Registers. Because of
      the architecture of the EPICS Modbus support, a driver that uses function 23 is
      restricted to being either a read-only driver where no data is written, or a write-only
      driver where no data is read. It is preferable to use functions codes 3, 4, 6, or
      16 if they are supported. However, some older devices only support function code
      23.</li>
  </ul>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <h2>
      Release 2-6</h2>
    <h2>
      April 10, 2014</h2>
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed a problem with function code 6 (write single register) on Wago devices when
      the MASK was not 0x0 or 0xFFFF. In this case a read/modify/write operation is required,
      and the driver was reading from the wrong address. On Wago devices the readback
      address for a register is offset by 0x200 from the write address. This offset was
      not being applied. </li>
    <li>Added 2 new records to statistics.template. $(P)$(R)HistTimeAxis is a waveform
      record that contains the X time axis for histogram plots, and MsPerBin is the time
      per histogram bin in msec.</li>
  </ul>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <h2>
      Release 2-5</h2>
    <h2>
      October 2, 2013</h2>
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed a mutex issue with the input poller. Previous versions had a potential problem
      with input records which did not use Scan=I/O Intr. In this case there was no mutex
      protecting access to the read buffer between the device support thread and the poller
      thread that was reading the Modbus data. It is likely that this problem was rarely
      if ever encountered because input records were almost always I/O Intr scanned. The
      fix was to remove the existing mutex in the driver and to simply call pasynManager->lockPort()
      for the entire duration of the polling cycle. This fix has a positive side effect:
      it is now possible for external clients, for example other drivers that call the
      Modbus driver, to temporarily disable the poller by calling pasynManager->lockPort().
      This can be used to allow atomic sequences of Modbus read/write operations with
      no possibility of interference from the poller.</li>
    <li>The above fix means that Modbus input drivers can now block on read operations,
      because they may need to wait for the poller to complete. These drivers are thus
      now created with the ASYN_CANBLOCK flag, and the documentation has been changed
      to state that input drivers are now asynchronous, not synchronous.</li>
    <li>Changed the wait for interruptAccept in the poller thread. It now works to have
      a very long polling time, but still having one initial read cycle and callback on
      I/O Intr scanned records.</li>
    <li>Added a new command to the Modbus driver, which has the drvUser string "MODBUS_READ".
      This command is implemented on the asynInt32 interface. Calling asynInt32->write()
      with this command causes a Modbus I/O cycle for this driver. It will typically be
      used to force a Modbus input driver to do a read operation independent of the poller
      thread.</li>
    <li>Added a new test driver called testModbusSyncIO.cpp. This driver is derived from
      asynPortDriver. It is designed to demonstrate using another asyn driver to communicate
      through the Modbus driver. This concept is currently being used to have a motor
      driver that communicates through the Modbus driver. It demonstrates two types of
      communication:
      <ol>
        <li>Using pasynInt32SyncIO calls to make "synchronous" calls to the Modbus driver.
          These calls are blocking and are queued.</li>
        <li>Doing an atomic "read/modify/write" cycle using the following sequence of operations.
          This uses pasynManager->lockPort to disable the poller and allow this thread to
          directly call the asynInt32->write() and asynInt32->read() functions. It uses the
          following logic:
          <ul>
            <li>Lock the output port. Needed because we are directly calling the write() function.</li>
            <li>Lock the input port, which disables the poller and because we are directly calling
              read().</li>
            <li>Sleep for 1 second so we can prove the poller was idle.</li>
            <li>Force a read of the Modbus input by writing on asynInt32 interface with the MODBUS_READ
              drvInfo.</li>
            <li>Read the input value on the asynInt32 interface.</li>
            <li>Add the value passed to this function to the current value just read.</li>
            <li>Sleep for 2 seconds so we can prove the poller was idle.</li>
            <li>Write the new value to the output driver.</li>
            <li>Unlock the input port.</li>
            <li>Unlock the output port.</li>
          </ul>
          This new example driver can be tested with the new files iocBoot/iocTest/sim3.cmd
          and sim3.substitutions. </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Minor change to structure packing declarations to allow building on ARM architecture
      with GCC 4.2.1</li>
  </ul>

    <h2>
      Release 2-4</h2>
    <h2>
      May 22, 2012</h2>
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>Improved support for different Modbus data types.
      <ul>
        <li>Added support for 7 new Modbus data types:
          <ul>
            <li>16-bit signed integer</li>
            <li>32-bit integer, little-endian</li>
            <li>32-bit integer, big-endian</li>
            <li>32-bit float, little-endian</li>
            <li>32-bit float, big-endian</li>
            <li>64-bit float, little-endian</li>
            <li>64-bit float, big-endian</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added support to allow the Modbus data type to be specified on a per-record bas
          using the asyn drvUser field. Previously all records connected to a Modbus asyn
          port driver had the same Modbus data type, because each Modbus port driver was limited
          to a single data type.</li>
        <li>If the drvUser string in the link specification is omitted, or if it is the default
          of MODBUS_DATA then the record will use the modbusDataType defined in drvModbusAsynConfigure.
          This is backwards compatible, and existing IOCs will continue to work with no changes
          to databases or startup scripts.</li>
        <li>Added new example IOC script, substitutions file, and medm screens to test all
          data types. The testing was done with a Modbus slave simulator.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Added special treatment for Wago devices. These device are different from other
      Modbus devices because the address to read back a register is not the same as the
      address to write the register. The readback address is the write address plus 0x200.
      This means that in previous versions of this driver the initial readback value for
      Modbus write operations to Wago devices was incorrect. This was fixed by adding
      the 0x200 offset to the readback address if the plcType argument to drvModbusAsynConfigure
      contains the substring "Wago" (case sensitive).</li>
    <li>Added support for passing status information back to device support in callbacks
      for I/O Intr scanned records. Support for this was added in asyn R4-19. This means
      that if the Modbus device communications returns errors that I/O Intr scanned records
      will now have their alarm status set correctly.</li>
  </ul>

      Release 2-3</h2>
    <h2>
      Sept 9, 2011</h2>
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>build changes</li>
    <li>added .opi files for CSS-BOY</li>
  </ul>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <h2>
      Release 2-2</h2>
    <h2>
      March 13, 2011</h2>
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>R2-0 introduced a 20 ms delay before each Modbus write. This was not correct,
      delays should only be needed for serial RTU. The Modicon Modbus Protocol Reference
      Guide says this must be at least 3.5 character times, e.g. about 3.5ms at 9600 baud,
      for Serial RTU. An additional writeDelayMsec parameter was added to modbusInterposeConfig.
      It is the final parameter, so if it is not specified the default value is zero,
      which is appropriate when not using Serial RTU. In the startup script lines like
      the following:
      <pre>
    modbusInterposeConfig("Koyo1",0,5000)
    </pre>
      should be changed to:
      <pre>
    modbusInterposeConfig("Koyo1",0,5000,0)
    </pre>
      for no delay, or to:
      <pre>
    modbusInterposeConfig("Koyo1",0,5000,20)
    </pre>
      for a 20 ms delay.</li>
  </ul>

    <h2>
      Release 2-1</h2>
    <h2>
      November 7, 2010</h2>
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>Bug fix. Non-automatic connection to the Modbus server uses pasynCommonSyncIO-&gt;connectDevice().
      The pasynUser being used for that operation was being created with pasynOctetSyncIO-&gt;connect().
      That was always an error, it must be created with pasynCommonSyncIO-&gt;connect().
      This error became serious with asyn R4-14, and non-automatic connection no longer
      worked.</li>
    <li>Previous releases of modbus recommended setting NoAutoConnect=1 when configuring
      the TCP or serial port. That was probably because of problems in connection management
      in earlier versions of asyn. With asyn R4-14 this is no longer necessary, and NoAutoConnect=0,
      the normal default, can be used with no problems. The example scripts Koyo1.cmd
      and Koyo2.cmd in the iocBoot directory have been changed to enable automatic connection
      to the IP or serial driver.</li>
  </ul>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <h2>
      Release 2-0</h2>
    <h2>
      November 26, 2009</h2>
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>Moved the slave address handling from the asynInterpose layer to the Modbus driver
      layer. This was done because handing it in the the interpose layer only allowed
      1 slave address per asyn serial port or IP port. This did not allow a single serial
      port to be used with multiple Modbus devices on an RS-485 bus, for example. <b>NOTE:
        This requires all startup command scripts to be changed, because the syntax of the
        modbusInterposeConfig and drvModbusAsynConfigure commands has changed.</b> Thanks
      to Yves Lussignol from CEA in France for making these changes.</li>
  </ul>

    <h2>
      Release 1-3</h2>
    <h2>
      September 19, 2008</h2>
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>Changed modbusInterpose.c to replace pasynOctet->writeRaw() and pasynOctet->readRaw()
      with pasynOctet->write() and pasynOctet->read(), because the raw routines have been
      removed in asyn R4-10.</li>
    <li>Changed the driver to use the asynStandardInterfaces interfaces added to asyn
      in R4-10.</li>
  </ul>

    <h2>
      Release 1-2</h2>

      September 6, 2007</h2>
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed bug in computing byteCount in WRITE_MULTIPLE_COILS function code.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    There is a known limitation with using serial interfaces. It is not currently possible
    to have multiple Modbus servers connected to a single serial port. This is a limitation
    of the asynInterposeInterface architecture used. It is fixed in release 2-0.</p>
