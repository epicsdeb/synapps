<h3>Release 1-7 April 25, 2003</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Changed the way averaging is done in the ip330Scan class
    again.&nbsp; Removed completely the concept of milliSecondsToAverage.&nbsp;
    Now the act of reading the value for a channel computes the average, and
    then resets the averaging process by setting the sum and number of samples
    back to 0.&nbsp; This has several advantages over the way things were done
    in Release 1-6:
    <ul>
      <li>It makes things much simpler, there is no need for device support to
        send its scan time to the server, nor any need for the server to keep
        track of individual averaging times for each channel. Device support
        does not then need to know about EPICS scan rates at all.</li>
      <li>The periodically scanned records work exactly as they did in Release
        1-6, since the average will be over the interval since the record was
        previously processed. Thus, a record scanned at 1 second will average
        for 1 second, etc.</li>
      <li>There is now a clean way to use it with EPICS scanning, i.e. to start
        averaging after changing an independent variable, and to average for a
        user-controlled period of time. Simply do the following with an ai
        record that is &quot;Passive&quot;</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <ol>
        <li>Change the independent variable</li>
        <li>Process the ai record: this resets the average</li>
        <li>Wait for the period of time you want to average for</li>
        <li>Process the ai record again, and read the value</li>
      </ol>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This release requires modifying the call to initIp330Scan() in the startup
    script, since the milliSecondsToAverage parameter no longer exists.</li>
  <li>Made two new abstract C++ base classes, fastSweep and fastPID. Ip330Sweep
    and Ip330PID are subclasses of these abstract base classes. The reason for
    doing this is that my support for Steve Ross' quad electrometer (in a new
    App called quadEM) has the same types of support (quadEMScan, quadEMSweep
    and quadEMPID). Using the abstract base classes reduces the amount of code
    to implement the device specific features to less than 2 pages each.&nbsp;
    devEpidIp330.dbd was replaced with devEpidMpf.dbd.</li>
  <li>Modified Ip330Sweep and Ip330PID. Previously if they were running at an
    integer divisor N of the Ip330 clock (N=2, 3, 4 ...) then they would simply
    ignore the intervening readings from the Ip330. In the new version they
    average the intervening readings. This avoids aliasing of high frequency
    components.</li>
  <li>Eliminated the function configIp330PID.&nbsp; This function did not work
    on the PowerPC and is not necessary.&nbsp; This may require modifications to
    existing startup scripts.</li>
  <li>Reduced number of source files, by combining ip330ScanServer.cc and
    Ip330Scan.h into ip300Scan.cc, etc.</li>
  <li>Eliminated the library file ip330ServLib, all code that needs to run on
    the MPF server is now in ip330Lib.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Release 1-6 March 31, 2003</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Changed the way averaging is done in the ip330Scan
    class.&nbsp; Previously there was a single averaging time for all input
    channels, that was set at boot time with the milliSecondsToAverage parameter
    in the call to initIp330Scan().&nbsp; This was not the best way to do it,
    since if an ai record was set to process every 2 seconds, but
    milliSecondsToAverage was 100 msec, then the ai record would just be
    sampling every 20'th average.&nbsp; A much better way to do it is to have
    the averaging time be equal to the scan time of the record, so that if the
    scan time is 2 seconds then the averaging is done for 2 seconds, greatly
    improving signal to noise.&nbsp; This has now been implemented by making the
    averaging time be independent for each input channel, and passing the scan
    time in the &quot;extra&quot; field of the message from device support to
    the server.&nbsp; Note that there is a limitation in the way this is
    presently implemented:&nbsp; it only works if the &quot;standard&quot; EPICS
    scan times of 10, 5, 2, 1, .5, .2 and .1 seconds are used.&nbsp; If a site
    changes these scan times it will not work correctly, because there is no API
    available to determine the actual scan time of a record.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<h3>Release 1-5 July 31, 2002 (Carl Lionberger and Eric Snow at SNS)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Moved interrupt enable to end of config.&nbsp; It was
    generating lots of interrupts before being fully configured.</li>
  <li>Properly masked mode control bits in setScanMode, was not working in modes
    other than burstContinuous</li>
  <li>Adjusted mailBoxOffset for uniformSingle and burstSingle scan modes in intFunc.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<h3>Release 1-4 October 12, 2001</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Added code to handle soft reboots.<br>
</ul>
<p></p>

<h3>Release 1-3 August 28, 2001</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Removed calls to intClear and intDisable. 
        These were not necessary and did not work on dumb IP carrier.<br>
</ul>
<p></p>

<h3>Release 1-2 January 16, 2001</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed a bug which caused the IOC to crash if the external trigger line
        was asserted during a hardware reboot.
    <li>Fixed bugs which caused the IOC to crash if the IP330 hardware was not
        installed but server configuration commands were present in the startup file.
</ul>
<p></p>

<h3>Release 1-1 November 1, 2000 (Marty Kraimer)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Added the configuration server.</li>
    <li>Added a lock that protects adj_slope and adj_offset
         from being changed while corrected values are computed.</li>
    <li>Force two data acquisition cycles during calibration.
        This is necessary to allow ADC to settle.</li>
    <li>After calibration set mailBoxOffset=16. Caused a bad reading.</li>
    <li>If secondsBetween Calibrate<0 then return raw value.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<h3>Release 1-02 September 10, 2000</h3>
<p>Changed ip330SweepServer.cc, removed Ip330SweepServer.h, and
replaced devMcaIp330.cc with a device-independent layer, devMcaMpf.cc. devMcaMpf.cc is part of
mcaApp, not part of Ip330,
since it is no longer specific to the Ip330. The messages
accepted by Ip330SweepServer have been changed to accommodate the
new device-independent layer.</p>

<p>Changes to the PID algorithm in ip330PID.cc to improve its
operation. See the comments in ip330PID.cc for details.</p>
<p></p>

<h3>Release 1-01 April 20, 2000</h3>
<p>Changed the timing logic. See the discussion in <a
href="#Restriction">Restrictions on Scan Timing</a>. </p>
<p></p>

<h3>Release 1-0 November 15, 1999</h3>
<p>This support replaces the previous ip330ScanApp. That support
did the following: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Digitized channels 0 to 15 in differential mode, or 0 to
        31 in single-ended mode </li>
    <li>Took a complete set of readings every millisecond.
        Actually the complete set of readings was taken every
        1.240 milliseconds in diffential mode and every 1.480
        milliseconds in single ended mode, because the 15
        microseconds to convert each channel was not taken into
        account when programming the interval timer. </li>
    <li>Averaged 200 samples for each channel. However, there was
        a bug in the software when running in differential mode.
        The data were always read from the lower mailbox
        registers (0-15) rather than alternating the reads
        between the lower and upper mailbox registers. Thus, only
        100 unique values were being averaged in this mode,
        rather than 200. </li>
    <li>Returned the average value to device support, thus every
        0.2 seconds a 200 sample average was supposed to be
        available. </li>
    <li>Once a minute calibration was done automatically. </li>
</ul>

<p>The new support can be configured to function exactly as the
previous support was intended to function with commands like the
following in the MPF server startup file: </p>

<pre>  pIp330 = initIp330(&quot;c-Ip330&quot;,carrier,&quot;IP_c&quot;,&quot;D&quot;,&quot;-5to5&quot;,0,15,10,120)
  configIp330(pIp330,3,&quot;Input&quot;,1000,60)
  initIp330Scan(pIp330,&quot;c-Ip330Scan&quot;,0,15,200,20)
</pre>

<p>The initIp330 command creates a task called
&quot;c-Ip330&quot;, with the following settings: </p>

<ul>
    <li>differential mode </li>
    <li>-5 to 5 volt range </li>
    <li>convert channels 0 to 15, </li>
    <li>10 clients (Ip330 application-specific servers) maximum </li>
    <li>interrupt vector = 120 </li>
</ul>

<p>The configIp330 command configures Ip330 with the following
settings: </p>

<ul>
    <li>scanMode = 3 = Burst Continuous </li>
    <li>external trigger = input </li>
    <li>1000 microseconds = 1 millisecond per scan </li>
    <li>60 seconds between calibrations </li>
</ul>

<p>The initIp330Scan command creates a server called
&quot;c-Ip330Scan&quot; with the following settings: </p>

<ul>
    <li>connected to the Ip330 object created by the initIp330
        command </li>
    <li>convert channels 0 to 15 </li>
    <li>average readings for 200 milliseconds </li>
    <li>create an output queue for 20 MPF messages </li>
</ul>
