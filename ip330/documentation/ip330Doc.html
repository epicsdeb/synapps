    This file describes support for the Acromag Ip300, a 16/32 channel, 16-bit A/D
    converter in the Industry Pack form factor. This support is a C driver that is based
    on <a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/modules/soft/asyn/">asyn</a>. It supports
    both the asynInt32 and asynFloat64 interfaces. The asynInt32 interface is used for
    ai records, and does callbacks to device support each time a new value is read from
    the hardware. This can cause the ai record to process on each callback. Alternatively
    the standard asyn Int32Average device support can be used with periodic ai record
    scanning to average the callback values that have happened since the last time the
    record processed. The asynFloat64 is provided for use with the fast feedback in
    the <a href="http://cars9.uchicago.edu/software/epics/epidRecord.html">EPID record</a>,
    which is part of the <a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/bcda/synApps/std/std.html">std</a>
    module in <a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/bcda/synApps/">synApps</a>. The asynInt32Array
    interface is used to do callbacks to an MCA record to implement waveform recorder/transient
    digitizer applications. All three modes (ai record, mca record, epid record) can
    be running simultaneously, and can even all be talking to the same input channels.
  </p>
  <p>
    The driver uses the <a href="https://svn.aps.anl.gov/trac/epics/ipac">ipac module</a>
    for Industry Pack communication.</p>

    Class Ip330</h2>
  <p>
    The only parameters of the IP330 module which are not configurable in the driver
    are the output data format (which is set to Straight Binary) and the Interrupt Control
    (which is set to interrupt after conversion of all selected channels). All other
    parameters of the IP330 can be configured (first and last channels to convert, scan
    mode, scan rate, trigger signal direction, etc.) Currently all parameters except
    the time between between calibrations. MPF servers and EPICS device support exist
    for the application-specific classes which sit above Ip330.

  <h3>
    Ip330 public interface</h3>
  <p>
    This is the public interface of the Ip330 class:
  </p>
  <pre>class Ip330
{
public:
    static Ip330 * init(
        const char *moduleName, const char *carrierName, const char *siteName,
        const char *type, const char *range, int firstChan, int lastChan,
        int maxClients, int intVec);
    int config(scanModeType scanMode, const char *triggerString, int
        microSecondsPerScan, int secondsBetweenCalibrate);
    int getCorrectedValue(int channel);
    int correctValue(int channel, int raw);
    int getRawValue(int channel);
    int setGain(int gain,int channel);
    int setScanMode(scanModeType scanMode);
    int setTrigger(triggerType trigger);
    float setMicroSecondsPerScan(float microSeconds);
    float getMicroSecondsPerScan();
    void setSecondsBetweenCalibrate(int seconds);
    int registerCallback(Ip330Callback callback, void *pvt);
</pre>
  <p>
    Brief description of these functions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><tt>init()</tt> and <tt>config()</tt> are called from <tt>initIp330</tt> and <tt>
      configIp330</tt> which are discussed below. </li>
    <li><tt>getRawValue()</tt> returns the A/D value for a channel without applying the
      calibration corrections for slope and offset. </li>
    <li><tt>getCorrectedValue()</tt> returns the A/D value for a channel after applying
      the calibration corrections for slope and offset. NOTE: If secondsBetweenCalibrate
      is less than zero then the raw A/D value is returned. </li>
    <li><tt>correctValue()</tt> corrects an input raw value for a channel by applying
      the calibration corrections for slope and offset. NOTE: If secondsBetweenCalibrate
      is less than zero then the raw A/D value is returned. </li>
    <li><tt>setGain()</tt> sets the gain for a channel. The specified gain must be {0,
      1, 2, or 3} corresponding to gains of {1, 2, 4, 8}. At initialization the gain of
      each channel is set to 0 and the channel calibrated. </li>
    <li><tt>setScanMode()</tt> sets the scan mode of the IP330. The scan modes are defined
      symbolically in <tt>Ip330.h</tt>. The most commonly used mode is <tt>burstContinuous</tt>,
      which digitizes all channels from firstChan to lastChan at 15 microseconds per channel,
      and then repeats this at an interval controlled by <tt>setMicroSecondsPerScan()</tt>.
    </li>
    <li><tt>setTrigger()</tt> sets the direction of the external trigger signal on the
      IP330 (input or output). The trigger directions are defined symbolically in <tt>Ip330.h</tt>.
    </li>
    <li><tt>setMicroSecondsPerScan()</tt> sets the number of microseconds per scan loop
      of the IP330. This time is only applicable when the scanMode is <tt>burstContinuous</tt>,
      <tt>uniformContinuous</tt>, or <tt>uniformSingle</tt>. This time will be the time
      between interrupts. It is automatically corrected for the 15 microsecond per channel
      conversion time of the IP330. The minimum value is equal to <tt>15*(lastChan-firstChan+1)</tt>.
    </li>
    <li><tt>getMicroSecondsPerScan()</tt> returns the number of microseconds per scan
      loop of the IP330. This value may not equal the requested time either because the
      requested time was too short or too long, or because of the granularity of the IP330
      timer. </li>
    <li><tt>setSecondsBetweenCalibrate()</tt> When secondsBetweenCalibrate is given a
      value
      <ul>
        <li>greater than zero, then all channels are calibrated every secondsBetweenCalibrate
          seconds.</li>
        <li>equal to zero, then all channels are calibrated once.</li>
        <li>less than zero then no calibration is done. In addition getCorrectedValue and
          correctValue both return the raw rather than converted value.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><tt>registerCallback()</tt> This function is called by application-specific classes
      to register their interrupt functions with Ip330. Ip330 will call the registered
      function every time an interrupt occurs, passing the <tt>pvt</tt> pointer, and a
      pointer to the new data. The <tt>pvt</tt> pointer is typically a pointer to the
      application class object. The Ip330 interrupt routine does the following:
      <ul>
        <li>Saves the floating point context so application interrupt functions can do floating
          point operations. </li>
        <li>Copies the data from the mailBox registers to a local buffer. </li>
        <li>Calls the interrupt function in each registered application class, passing the
          <tt>pvt</tt> pointer, and a pointer to the local copy of the data. </li>
        <li>Restores the floating point context. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    Ip330 configuration</h3>
  <p>
    The Ip330 is configured by calling the following functions from the vxWorks startup
    file.
  </p>
  <pre>extern &quot;C&quot; Ip330 *initIp330(
    const char *moduleName, const char *carrierName, const char *siteName,
    const char *typeString, const char *rangeString,
    int firstChan, int lastChan,
    int maxClients, int intVec)

# function return value  = pointer to the Ip330 object, needed by configIp330
#                          and to initialize the application-specific classes
# moduleName  = name to give this module
# carrierName = name of IPAC carrier from initIpacCarrier
# siteName    = name of IP site, e.g. &quot;IP_a&quot;
# typeString  = &quot;D&quot; or &quot;S&quot; for differential or single-ended
# rangeString = &quot;-5to5&quot;,&quot;-10to10&quot;,&quot;0to5&quot;, or &quot;0to10&quot;
#               This value must match hardware setting selected with DIP switches
# firstChan   = first channel to be digitized.  This must be in the range:
#               0 to 31 (single-ended)
#               0 to 15 (differential)
# lastChan    = last channel to be digitized
# maxClients =  Maximum number of Ip330 tasks which will attach to this
#               Ip330 module.  For example Ip330Scan, Ip330Sweep, etc.  This
#               does not refer to the number of EPICS clients.  A value of
#               10 should certainly be safe.
# intVec        Interrupt vector

extern &quot;C&quot; int configIp330(
    Ip330 *pIp330,
    scanModeType scanMode, const char *triggerString,
    int microSecondsPerScan, int secondsBetweenCalibrate)

# pIp330      = pointer to the Ip330 object, returned by initIp330 above
# scanMode    = scan mode:
#               0 = disable
#               1 = uniformContinuous
#               2 = uniformSingle
#               3 = burstContinuous (normally recommended)
#               4 = burstSingle
#               5 = convertOnExternalTriggerOnly
# triggerString = &quot;Input&quot; or &quot;Output&quot;. Selects the direction of the external
#               trigger signal.
# microSecondsPerScan = repeat interval to digitize all channels
#               The minimum theoretical time is 15 microseconds times the
#               number of channels, but a practical limit is probably 100
#               microseconds.  Larger values reduce CPU usage, but decrease
#               the number of callbacks per second to the application classes.
#               This will reduce the number of measurement averages in the
#               ip330Scan class,  increase the granularity in the time per
#               point for the ip330Sweep class, and decrease the number of
#               feedback cycles per second for the ip330PID class.
# secondsBetweenCalibrate = number of seconds between calibration cycles.
#               If zero then there will be no periodic calibration, but
#               one calibration will still be done at initialization.
#               If less than zero then no calibration is done.
#               NOTE: setGain() also causes a calibration.
</pre>
  <p>
    Note that the reason for having <tt>configIp330</tt>, rather than just <tt>initIp330</tt>
    is simply that there are more than 10 configurable parameters, but vxWorks only
    allows 10 arguments to be passed to functions which are called from the shell.
  </p>

    Ip330Config Server</h2>
  <p>
    A server and device support are provided to dynamically change configuration values.
    Currently this only provides support for changing setSecondsBetweenCalibrate.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Ip330Config EPICS Device Support</h3>
  <p>
    The current device support is for a longout record. It sends an Int32Messages with
    the following info:

 servername     Must match the serverName specified with initIp330Config
 cmd		Default is 0,which for now is the only valid value.

 field(VAL)     When the record is processed the value of the VAL field
                is setSecondsBetweenCalibrate. See above for meaning.
</pre>
  <p>
    A typical use is to have a passive longout record. If the VAL field is 0, then each
    time the record is processed calibration will be performed.</p>
  <h2 id="Ip330Scan" style="text-align: center">
    Class Ip330Scan</h2>
  <p>
    This class provides the functions of an averaging A/D converter. Together with class
    Ip330 it provides the same functionality as Ip330ScanApp in previous releases of
    MPF.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Ip330Scan public interface</h3>

</pre>
  <p>
    Brief description of these functions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><tt>Ip330Scan</tt>();<br />
      <tt>getValue()</tt> returns the averaged A/D value for a channel. This value is
      corrected for slope and offset using the calibration data. This is the value returned
      to EPICS by Ip330ScanServer.</li>
    <li><tt>setGain()</tt> sets the gain for this channel. See <tt>Ip330::setGain()</tt>
      for more information.</li>

    Restrictions on Scan Timing</h2>
  <p>
    In an earlier release of this package (1.0) each of the application-specific classes
    (Ip330Scan, Ip330Sweep, Ip330PID) had a function to control the scan rate of the
    Ip330. However, there is only a single interval timer in the IP330 hardware, and
    so if one class changed the scan rate it would change the scan rate for all of the
    other classes. This interaction was undesirable, and so the behavior was changed,
    starting with release 1.01. The value of <tt>microSecondsPerScan</tt> specified
    in <tt>configIp330</tt> is never changed by any application classes. Each application
    class will have its callback routine executed at this time interval. The application
    class will determine what to do when it is called back. For example, in the <tt>ip330Sweep</tt>
    class if <tt>microSecondsPerPoint</tt> is 1000, and <tt>ip330-&gt;microSecondsPerScan</tt>
    is 500, then the <tt>ip330Sweep</tt> callback routine returns immediately without
    doing anything on every other call. This behavior eliminates any interaction between
    the timing for the different application classes. The limitation is that the granularity
    of the time intervals available to an application class is now limited to the value
    of <tt>microSecondsPerScan</tt> specified in <tt>configIp330</tt>, whereas previously
    the granularity was 8 microseconds. Thus, for example, if <tt>microSecondsPerScan</tt>
    is 500 microseconds then the dwell times available in the <tt>ip330Sweep</tt> class
    are limited to multiples of 500 microseconds.
